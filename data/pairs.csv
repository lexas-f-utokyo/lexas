PMC5509424,"Considering that the expression levels of several important cell cycle proteins required for proper G1 progression are affected upon depletion of NEK7 ( Figure 1, D–F ), we next investigated whether cells that are already in S-phase can complete DNA replication and undergo mitosis normally in the absence of NEK7.","To overcome the G1 arrest that was induced upon prolonged NEK7 depletion, we treated U2OS cells with either control or NEK7 siRNAs for 8 h and then arrested these cells at the G1/S transition or in S-phase by adding thymidine to the medium for 16 h, followed by subsequent release into fresh medium and sample collection ( Figure 2A ).",nek7,nek7

PMC6777370,Representative high-resolution immunofluorescence images of Plk4 with and without the centriole marker CEP152 (B) and the ring-filling indices (C) for the three conditions.,"HeLa cells were transfected with siControl, siSTIL or siHsSAS6 and then stained with antibodies to STIL or HsSAS6 and the centriole marker pericentrin (PCNT).",cep152,stil
PMC7812875,"As expected, the amount of pericentrin at PCM poles was significantly increased, presumably due to the increased PCM fragmentation at centriolar poles after CEP57 depletion ( Fig. 5, A–C ).","Subsequently, to analyze the effect of CEP57 depletion on the mitotic processes of one-centrosome cells, we performed time-lapse imaging of NuMA and microtubules.",cep57,cep57
PMC4220463,"First, to investigate the physical interactions between the three key factors for centriole assembly, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation analysis with human 293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged full-length Plk4 or Plk4ΔPEST lacking the first PEST destruction motif 25 , and tested whether the Plk4 proteins interact with endogenous STIL or HsSAS-6 proteins.","Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and  in vitro  binding assays established that Plk4 directly bound to the STIL fragments containing the CC domain presumably in a kinase-activity-dependent manner ( Fig. 1e  and  Supplementary Fig. 1g,h ).",stil,plk4

(H)  Precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis induced by Cep57 depletion was not rescued by exogenous expression of Cep57L1.",cep57,cep57
PMC6389942,"Whereas depletion of endogenous PCNT caused precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis, expression of the full-length PCNT functionally rescued this phenotype (Fig.  5d, e ).","In contrast, the two binding-deficient mutants failed to rescue the phenotype provoked by depletion of endogenous PCNT (Fig.  5d, e ).",pcnt,pcnt
PMC7836272,"Precocious centriole disengagement in G 2 /M phase-arrested cells was also suppressed by Plk1 inhibition ( Prosser et al., 2012 ).","To determine whether the precocious centriole disengagement in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells also requires Plk1 activity, we treated G 2  phase-arrested cells or Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with a small-molecule inhibitor of Plk1 (BI2536).",plk1,plk1
PMC6389942,"Given that the cleavage of PCNT, a major PCM component, by separase is required for mitotic centriole disengagement 9 , 10 , and also the fact that, among major PCM components that we tested, depletion of PCNT only caused precocious centriole disengagement in early mitosis (Supplementary Fig.  6a, b ), we examined whether Cep57 physically interacts with PCNT.","Using co-IP assay with deletion constructs of Cep57, we narrowed down the Cep57 region required for PCNT-binding to the short stretch spanning a.a.",pcnt,cep57
PMC7812875,"To further investigate this defect upon depletion of pericentrin, we performed live-cell imaging of mitotic spindle formation in HeLa and HCT116 cells.","Depletion of pericentrin delayed the elongation of two spindle poles ( Fig. 7, E and F ;  Fig. S4, A and B ;  Videos 13 ,  14 ,  27 , and  28 ).",pericentrin,pericentrin
