PMC5509424,"Considering that the expression levels of several important cell cycle proteins required for proper G1 progression are affected upon depletion of NEK7 ( Figure 1, D–F ), we next investigated whether cells that are already in S-phase can complete DNA replication and undergo mitosis normally in the absence of NEK7.","To overcome the G1 arrest that was induced upon prolonged NEK7 depletion, we treated U2OS cells with either control or NEK7 siRNAs for 8 h and then arrested these cells at the G1/S transition or in S-phase by adding thymidine to the medium for 16 h, followed by subsequent release into fresh medium and sample collection ( Figure 2A ).",nek7,nek7
PMC5509424,"The APC/C cofactor Cdc20, which is expressed from early S-phase to late mitosis, was also significantly down-regulated upon NEK7 depletion ( Figure 1E ).","To further confirm that NEK7 depletion induces a G1 arrest, we looked at p21 levels in U2OS cells that were treated with control and NEK7 siRNAs for 48 h. It is known that high levels of p21 can inhibit S-phase entry through the direct inhibition of CDK2 activity as well as by binding proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to inhibit DNA synthesis ( Abbas and Dutta, 2009 ).",nek7,nek7
