353,0,Although inhibition of p38 MAPK resulted in overall decreases in Eo/B CFU derived from stimulation by three hematopoietic cytokines–findings observed by others  [22]  – it was the inhibition of [GENE] 1/2 in the cultures that resulted in the specific [EXPE] of GM-CSF- and IL-3-responsive Eo/B CFU

383,0,However subsequent [GENE] mediated [EXPE] of PICyts may implicate the decrease in damage to the host by its exacerbating immune response
384,0,Cells transfected with either control or γ-CYA–specific [EXPE] were grown to confluence and on day 3 posttransfection mechanically wounded by scratching the monolayers by dragging a 200-μl pipette [GENE] across
385,1,Furthermore global [EXPE] of [GENE] in TRAMP mice completely suppresses the development of Syp+ NE tumors indicating SRC-3 is absolutely required for NE tumor development from these intermediate/progenitor cells
386,0,IncA/C plasmids were first identified more than 40 years ago from diseased fish [EXPE] by antibiotic-resistant  Aeromonas hydrophila  and  Vibrio  [GENE]  [3]   [4]
387,0,When we compared the staining profiles in female  RIIB −/−  and  [GENE] 129  mice at 24 weeks of age we observed that the peripheral-type staining was dominant in  SLAM 129  mice (Figure  3 C  lower ) suggesting that the compositions of ANAs produced by  RIIB [EXPE]  and  SLAM 129  mice at 24 weeks of age are qualitatively different as determined based on the HEp-2 cell staining profiles albeit the assay used is not sufficiently quantitative
388,1,The low-dose [GENE] eNOS [EXPE] mice in which diabetes was induced at 4–6 months of age also showed lower survival rate (70% at 6 months after diabetes) [ 34 ]
389,0,We further examined the combined effects of [EXPE] for LKB1 and siRNA for TAK1 or STO-609 on [GENE] activation by hydroxyfasudil
390,0,[GENE] loosening was the only complication seen in three cases due to pin track [EXPE] necessities removal of infected pin
391,0,The protein levels of Isl1 Dppa4 and Gdf3 were also examined after [GENE] depletion or miR-383 [EXPE]
