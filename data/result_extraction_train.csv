207,1,We observed that only Nup62 but not [GENE] or vector alone could partially [EXPE] the defects (  Fig 6G ;  Fig S2  ) 
208,1,Because Mps1 binds MCRS1  we wanted to examine whether [GENE] phosphorylated MCRS1 in an in vitro kinase [EXPE]

211,0,After [GENE] inhibition  time lapse [EXPE] of actin ( Lifeact-mCherry ) confirmed the loss of blebbing (  Figure 3E  ) 
212,1,"We also found that [EXPE] of [GENE] WT ( under CMV promoter ) induced a uniform ring-like structure of Plk4pS305 around the mother centriole , suggesting that Plk4 over-condensation induced by its overexpression promoted autonomous activation on the mother centriole wall ( Supplementary Fig.  10e  )."
213,0,[GENE] expression levels were unaltered in Rab6 [EXPE] cells (  Supplementary Figure S3B  ) 
214,0,Most importantly  the aberrant mitosis induced by DAB2IP [EXPE] was reversed by expressing siRNA-resistant [GENE] protein

234,0,"however , [EXPE] imaging revealed that meiosis i spindles frequently disassemble in cdc14-1  cells , only to reassemble at the presumptive time of meiosis ii (  bizzari & marston , 2011  ) , suggesting that [GENE] may be refractory for spindle disassembly and meiosis i exit"
235,0,Thus  the metaphase arrest due to LIC2 [EXPE] was mediated through an active [GENE]  like for its homolog LIC1 [ 22 ] 
236,1,Thus  the marked defects observed with GFP-ΔC may partly be due to the concurrent [EXPE] of release of full length [GENE]

254,0,Despite the Cdk1 [EXPE]  Aurkb was still associated with [GENE] ( Figure  2G  ) 
255,1,"In contrast , [EXPE] of [GENE] activity in mitotic cells led to the emergence of a high level of γH2AX on the chromosome arms and at some of the telomeres in a number of ALT cell lines including SUSM1 , W138-VA13/2RA and GM847 ( Figure  5C – H  )."

257,0,"however , the inability of protame to inhibit yfp‐mcl‐1 loss even when combined with cdc20 [EXPE] ( fig  ev4 a ) favours the conclusion that apc/c‐dependent mcl‐1 degradation during mitotic arrest does not require the stimulation of the apc/c by [GENE]"
258,0,"although [EXPE] of aurora b and plk-1 did not affect the actin cluster dynamics at all ( unpublished data ) , cdk1 inhibition by ro3306 (  vassilev et al. , 2006  ) resulted in the disappearance of the actin cluster , which suggests the requirement of [GENE] activity for the actin cluster dynamics"

208,0,"to further corroborate the notion that [GENE] expression levels have a negligible effect on the sensitivity to spindle poisons like taxol and vincristine , we introduced the suntag-cas9 ( [EXPE] ) system in [G] cells , which allows specific and robust transcriptional activation of genes of interest through sgrna-cas9-mediated targeting of synthetic transcriptional activators to upstream regions of transcriptional start sites ( tss ) ( figure  3a  , [ 30  ,  31 ] )"
