2021	PMC7836272	We recently reported that the Cep57–PCNT interaction is crucial for the maintenance of centriole engagement during mitosis and that depletion of Cep57 causes precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis, but not in interphase (mitosis, 42.2 ± 5.1%; interphase, 0%;  n  = 30 and 50, respectively, from three independent experiments;  Fig. 1, A and B ;  Watanabe et al., 2019 ).#####Although the mechanism of centriole engagement in mitosis is gradually being elucidated, that of interphase remains completely unknown.#####To address this, we sought to identify the molecules required for centriole engagement during interphase.#####Given that comprehensive RNAi-based screens have failed to identify such molecules thus far, we assumed that two or more molecules have redundant functions in the maintenance of centriole engagement during interphase.#####Taking this possibility into account, we considered Cep57 and PCNT as potential targets.#####We also focused on an uncharacterized paralog of Cep57 in addition to Cep57 and PCNT: Cep57L1.#####Cep57L1 is a conserved protein in vertebrates and consists of 460 amino acid residues with 39% sequence homology to Cep57 in  Homo sapiens  ( Fig. S1 A ).#####We found that depletion of Cep57L1 did not affect centriole engagement in either interphase or mitosis ( Fig. 1 E ).#####We accordingly tested codepletion of two of the three proteins Cep57, Cep57L1, and PCNT by treating human cells with two distinct siRNAs, and we observed the centrosome and centriole behaviors.#####Among these combinations, we first found that codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 (Cep57/Cep57L1) caused an increase in the number of centrosomes, marked by Cep192, in interphase (46.6 ± 17.7%;  n  = 50; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 1, C and D ).#####Interestingly, we next found by using a centriole maker, coiled-coil protein 110 (CP110), that ∼30% of the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells exhibited an abnormal centriole pattern, including precocious centriole disengagement in interphase (16.0 ± 5.3%;  n  = 50; from three independent experiments; we defined precocious centriole disengagement as being when at least one centriole is more than 0.75 µm away from the others;  Fig. 1, C and E ; and more than four centrioles [11.3 ± 7.6%;  Fig. 1, C and F ]).#####We also noticed that such Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells could possess more than two Cep192 foci even in the S phase ( Fig. S1 B ).#####The efficiency of the siRNAs was validated by quantifying mRNAs using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and also by measuring the signal intensities of Cep57 and Cep57L1 at old mother centrioles ( Fig. S1, C and D ).#####The phenotypes provoked by codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 were also confirmed by using a different siRNA and other human cell lines ( Fig. S1, E and F ).#####As expected, the phenotypes were rescued by expressing a synthetic RNAi-resistant Cep57 or Cep57L1 construct (siControl, 2.2 ± 1.9%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 33.2 ± 2.9%; siCep57/Cep57L1 + Cep57 expression, 10.0 ± 3.3%; siCep57/Cep57L1 + Cep57L1 expression, 6.7 ± 3.3%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 1, G and H ).#####Furthermore, the phenotypes were also confirmed by CRISPR/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-mediated codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 (8.0 ± 5.3% [precocious centriole disengagement]; 26.7 ± 2.3% [more than four centrioles];  n  = 50; from three independent experiments;  Fig. S1 G ).#####The efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion was validated by measuring the signal intensities of Cep57 and Cep57L1 at the centrosomes ( Fig. S1, I and J ).#####Taking these data together, we conclude that codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 increases the number of centrosomes and centrioles during interphase.

2021	PMC7836272	In general, the presence of four separate centrioles in interphase can stem from a failure of cytokinesis.#####To investigate whether the phenotype seen with codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 is due to a failure of cytokinesis or to precocious centriole disengagement during interphase, we immunostained HeLa cells with an antibody against outer dense fiber protein 2 (ODF2), a marker of old mother centrioles ( Fig. S2, A and B ).#####If the four separate centrioles were the consequence of a failure of cytokinesis, the number of old mother centrioles in an interphase cell should be two.#####However, >80% of the HeLa cells with four separate centrioles or amplified centrioles possessed only one ODF2 focus (84.8 ± 1.7%;  n  > 50; from two independent experiments), as was the case in control cells (100%;  Fig. S2, A and B ).#####We therefore reasoned that the separate centrioles likely resulted from precocious centriole disengagement in interphase rather than from cytokinesis failure.#####To confirm this idea, we determined when in the cell cycle the phenotype could be observed in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells using 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; an S phase marker) and an antibody against centromere protein F (CENP-F; a G 2  phase marker).#####Immunofluorescence (IF) with the cell cycle markers indicated that, as in control cells, there were two centrioles in the G 1  phase in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells (EdU-negative, CENP-F–negative cells), but ∼25% of S phase cells (EdU-positive, CENP-F–negative cells) and 43% of G 2  phase cells (CENP-F–positive cells) exhibited four or more separate centrioles (S phase, 24.9 ± 2.0%; G 2  phase, 42.9 ± 10.1%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 2, A–C ).#####These data strongly suggest that the presence of the four separate centrioles observed during interphase in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells stem from precocious centriole disengagement in the S and G 2  phases.#####Furthermore, live-cell imaging analysis using HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-centrin1 (HeLa-GFP-centrin1) confirmed that precocious centriole disengagement occurred during interphase in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells ( Fig. 2 D  and  Video 1 ).#####We also measured cumulative percentages of the disengagement phenotype on the basis of live-cell imaging data and found that ∼60% of Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells (16 of 26 cells) exhibited a disengagement phenotype before cell roundup; that is, in interphase ( Fig. 2 E ; mean time, siControl t = 4.20 h; siCep57/Cep57L1 t = −2.76 h; time 0 corresponds to the cell roundup).#####The precociously disengaged centrioles were repeatedly assembled and dispersed during interphase ( Video 2 ).#####Importantly, we also found that centriole disengagement was occasionally followed by centriole reduplication ( Fig. 2 E ) and that around one-fifth of Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells possessed more than four centrioles in the G 2  phase (22.1 ± 11.1%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 2 C ).#####Taken together, these data suggest that Cep57 and Cep57L1 cooperatively regulate the maintenance of centriole engagement during interphase and thus suppress centriole reduplication within the same cell cycle.

2021	PMC7836272	Previous studies have reported that the G 2  phase cell cycle arrest induced by treatment with a Cdk1 inhibitor or DNA-damaging reagents caused precocious centriole disengagement ( Prosser et al., 2012 ;  Douthwright and Sluder, 2014 ).#####To examine whether codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 induces cell cycle arrest in interphase, we performed a live-cell imaging analysis and measured the duration of the period from anaphase onset to cell roundup in the next mitosis.#####In Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, the duration was not significantly altered compared with control cells (siControl, 26.8 ± 2.2 h; siCep57/Cep57L1, 26.2 ± 3.6 h;  n  = 30;  Fig. S2 C ).#####In addition, FACS profiling analysis revealed that the distribution of cell cycle phases was not affected by Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion ( Fig. S2 D ).#####Overall, these findings reveal that codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 causes precocious centriole disengagement starting in the S phase without affecting the cell cycle progression.
2021	PMC7836272	Given that, after codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1, precocious centriole disengagement was apparent starting in the S phase and that centriole formation proceeds during the S phase, we next examined whether the precocious centriole disengagement occurs before full elongation of daughter centrioles.#####To address this, we used proteome of centriole 5 (POC5), which is known to be incorporated at the final stage of daughter centriole formation ( Chang et al., 2016 ;  Azimzadeh et al., 2009 ).#####In control cells, all of the disengaged centrioles were POC5 positive after mitotic exit (90.0 ± 3.3%;  Fig. 3 A ).#####In contrast, in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, POC5 signal was not detected at approximately half of the disengaged centrioles (42.9% ± 4.0%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments), suggesting that upon codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1, a daughter centriole can disengage from the mother centriole during the process of its formation ( Fig. 3, A and B ).

PCNT was recruited into disengaged daughter centrioles mainly in the G 2  phase and mitosis.#####All scale bars, 5 µm in the low-magnification view, 1 µm in the inset.
2021	PMC7836272	Because disengaged daughter centrioles are converted into centrosomes after mitosis in normal cells (a process called “centriole-to-centrosome conversion”;  Wang et al., 2011 ), we then asked if the precociously disengaged daughter centrioles accomplish the centriole-to-centrosome conversion in interphase.#####In normal cells, around mitotic exit, a disengaged daughter centriole becomes a functional centrosome and recruits PCM components and centriole duplication factors, such as PCNT and Cep152, respectively.#####For this conversion, procentriole formation requires the centriolar recruitment of Cep295 and Cep192 ( Tsuchiya et al., 2016 ;  Fu et al., 2016 ).#####Similar to Cep192 ( Fig. S1 B ), Cep295 was localized at almost all of the precociously disengaged daughter centrioles ( Fig. S2 E ).#####In contrast, the disengaged daughter centrioles did not always acquire PCM components (PCNT), suggesting that PCM proteins were gradually recruited to the disengaged daughter centrioles.#####Indeed, Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with more than two PCNT-positive centrioles were relatively rare before the G 2  phase (15.0 ± 2.4%;  n  = 30 from three independent experiments) but gradually increased during the G 2  phase (51.7 ± 2.4%) and were most frequently observed after the G 2  phase was completed (mitosis, 85.0 ± 11.8%;  Fig. 3, C and D ;  Fig. S2, F and G ).#####These observations show that the precociously disengaged daughter centrioles first lacked PCM and then gradually recruited PCM components to their surroundings mainly during the G 2  phase and mitosis ( Figs. 3 E  and  S2 H ).#####Furthermore, such disengaged daughter centrioles nucleated microtubules after depolymerization of microtubules by cold treatment, indicating that these centrioles had acquired MTOC activity during interphase ( Fig. S2 I ).#####Taken together, these results indicate that upon Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion, the precociously disengaged centrioles can be converted to centrosomes starting in interphase.
2021	PMC7836272	To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion causes precocious centriole disengagement in interphase, we tested a requirement of the known factors involved in centriole disengagement at the end of mitosis.#####Previous studies have reported that canonical centriole disengagement requires Plk1 activity and that the inhibition of Plk1 perturbs centriole disengagement at the end of mitosis ( Tsou et al., 2009 ).#####Precocious centriole disengagement in G 2 /M phase-arrested cells was also suppressed by Plk1 inhibition ( Prosser et al., 2012 ).#####To determine whether the precocious centriole disengagement in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells also requires Plk1 activity, we treated G 2  phase-arrested cells or Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with a small-molecule inhibitor of Plk1 (BI2536).#####As expected, the precocious centriole disengagement or the increase in the number of centrioles in G 2 /M-arrested cells was suppressed by BI2536 treatment (RO3306, 57.2 ± 4.8%; RO3306/BI2536, 5.3 ± 2.4%;  n  = 50 from three independent experiments;  Fig. 4, A and B ).#####In contrast, BI2536 treatment did not suppress the precocious centriole disengagement or the increase in the number of centrioles in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells (DMSO, 46.7 ± 10.0%; BI2536, 45.6 ± 10.1%;  n  = 30 from three independent experiments;  Fig. 4, C and D ).#####These data indicate that the precocious centriole disengagement that occurs in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells does not depend on Plk1 activity, unlike canonical centriole disengagement or cell cycle arrest–induced precocious centriole disengagement.

2021	PMC7836272	Because Plk1 is necessary not only for centriole disengagement but also for daughter centrioles to acquire PCM in normal cells ( Wang et al., 2011 ), we next asked if Plk1 activity is also required for PCM recruitment at precociously disengaged daughter centrioles in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells.#####To address this, we treated Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with BI2536 and counted the number of PCM-positive centrioles.#####Interestingly, in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, BI2536 treatment significantly reduced the number of cells with disengaged centrioles that have acquired PCNT (13.1 ± 4.3%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments) compared with the DMSO-treated cells (51.6 ± 2.4%;  Fig. 4, E and F ), indicating that Plk1 activity is required for PCNT recruitment to the disengaged daughter centrioles.#####Similarly, γ-tubulin recruitment to the disengaged daughter centrioles was also suppressed by BI2536 treatment (DMSO, 55.1 ± 7.1%; BI2536, 10.0 ± 9.4%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 4 G ).#####Overall, these findings demonstrate that the precociously disengaged daughter centrioles acquire PCM during the interphase in a Plk1-dependent manner ( Fig. 4 H ).#####Given that Plk1 is activated starting from the late G 2  stage and preceding mitosis ( Schmucker and Sumara, 2014 ) and is necessary for PCM recruitment to the disengaged daughter centrioles, it is reasonable that precociously disengaged daughter centrioles gradually acquire PCNT in the G 2  phase ( Fig. 3, C and D ).
2021	PMC7836272	Although Cep57 and Cep57L1 cooperatively regulate centriole engagement in interphase, centriole engagement in mitosis is maintained by Cep57 but not by Cep57L1.#####This suggests that Cep57 and Cep57L1 have both redundant and distinct functions in centriole engagement.#####To investigate the similarities and differences between the functions of Cep57 and Cep57L1 in the regulation of centrioles, we performed localization and domain analysis of Cep57 and Cep57L1.#####We first sought to compare the detailed localization pattern of Cep57 and Cep57L1 at the centrosomes.#####To do this, we immunostained HeLa cells with an antibody against Cep57L1 and found that endogenous Cep57L1 localized at mother centrioles ( Fig. 5 A ).#####Similarly to Cep57, the signal intensity of Cep57L1 at new mother centrioles gradually increased in interphase ( Fig. 5 A ;  Watanabe et al., 2019 ).#####We also noticed that the signal intensity of Cep57 further increased toward mitosis, whereas that of Cep57L1 decreased ( Fig. S3, A–D ).#####Moreover, stimulated emission depletion (STED) analysis showed that Cep57L1 formed a ring-like structure around the mother centriole ( Fig. 5 B ).#####The radius of the Cep57L1 ring was 111.1 ± 6.6 nm, which was close to that of the Cep57 ring (108.3 ± 8.1 nm;  Fig. 5 B ).#####STED microscopy also revealed the colocalization of Cep57 and Cep57L1 around the mother centriole ( Fig. S3 E ).#####The specificity of the antibody was validated using siRNA against Cep57L1 ( Fig. 5 C ).#####To examine the mutual dependency on centriole localization, using STED microscopy, we observed the localization pattern of Cep57 and Cep57L1 at centrioles upon reciprocal siRNA treatment.#####Depletion of Cep57 or Cep57L1 did not significantly affect each other’s localization pattern at centrioles ( Fig. 5 C ;  Fig. S3, F and G ).#####Overall, these results indicate that Cep57 and Cep57L1 show a similar centriolar distribution but independently localize to the centrosome.

2021	PMC7836272	To further examine the similarities and differences between Cep57 and Cep57L1 function, we next performed domain analysis of Cep57 and Cep57L1.#####We previously reported that the conserved PINC (present in N-terminus of Cep57) domain in the N-terminus of Cep57 is required for its centriolar localization and the interaction with PCNT, a functional binding partner ( Watanabe et al., 2019 ).#####Because Cep57L1 also has a PINC domain, we asked if the role of the PINC motif in Cep57L1 was similar to its role in Cep57.#####To address this, we constructed plasmids expressing the full-length Cep57L1 or a mutant lacking the PINC motif (52–86 aa).#####Unexpectedly, IF and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses with the mutant revealed that the PINC motif of Cep57L1 was dispensable for the centrosomal localization ( Fig. S4 A ) and for the binding to the PCNT C-terminal region, including the PACT domain ( Fig. S4 B ).#####These data suggest that the PINC motif has different functions in Cep57 and Cep57L1.#####In addition to the PINC motif, the Pfam protein family database predicted the presence of microtubule-binding domains in both Cep57 and Cep57L1 ( Fig. S1 A ).#####As previously reported, overexpressed Cep57 was occasionally localized on the microtubule network via its microtubule-binding domain ( Fig. S4 C ;  Momotani et al., 2008 ).#####In contrast, overexpressed Cep57L1 did not show such a localization pattern, but instead aggregated in the cytoplasm ( Fig. S4 C ).#####This result suggests that the putative microtubule-binding domain of Cep57L1 does not possess a binding affinity for microtubules.#####Furthermore, co-IP assays of Cep57 and Cep57L1 proteins in HEK293T cells detected self-interaction of Cep57L1 but not of Cep57 ( Fig. S4 D ).#####Overall, these findings show that Cep57 and Cep57L1 have distinct properties in spite of their relatively high amino acid sequence homology.

2021	PMC7836272	We next searched for the proteins recruiting Cep57L1 to the centrosome.#####Considering the similar distribution patterns of Cep57 and Cep57L1 at the centrosomes, we postulated that the localization of Cep57 and Cep57L1 around the centriole wall is regulated by common proteins.#####Cep57 is recruited to the centrosomes dependent on Cep63, Cep152, and NEDD1 ( Aziz et al., 2018 ;  Wu et al., 2012 ;  Lukinavičius et al., 2013 ).#####Of these three proteins, Cep63 and Cep152 were demonstrated to form a trimeric complex with Cep57 at the centrosomes ( Lukinavičius et al., 2013 ).#####Consistent with previous studies ( Aziz et al., 2018 ;  Lukinavičius et al., 2013 ), we confirmed that Cep63 (median, 30.6% compared with siControl;  n  > 50) or Cep152 depletion (19.3%) significantly decreased the signal intensity of Cep57 at the centrosomes ( Fig. 6, A and D ).#####We then assumed that Cep63 and Cep152 were also responsible for centrosomal localization of Cep57L1.#####As expected, depletion of Cep63 (24.8%) or Cep152 (45.8%) reduced the signal intensity of Cep57L1 at the centrosomes, indicating that both Cep57 and Cep57L1 localization at the centrosomes was partially dependent on Cep63 and Cep152 ( Fig. 6, A and D ).#####On the other hand, the signal intensity of Cep63 and Cep152 at the centrosomes was only slightly affected by depletion of Cep57 (Cep63, 81.0%; Cep152, 80.2%) or Cep57L1 (Cep63, 70.6%; Cep152, 81.0%), whereas codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 reduced the signal intensity of Cep152 at the centrosomes more drastically (31.1%;  Fig. 6, B–D ).#####Moreover, as reported in previous studies ( Lukinavičius et al., 2013 ;  Kim et al., 2019 ;  Brown et al., 2013 ), the signal intensity of Cep152 was attenuated by Cep63 depletion (25.8%) and vice versa (66.4%;  Fig. 6 D ).#####Hence, we propose that Cep57, Cep57L1, Cep63, and Cep152 mutually influence centrosomal localization ( Fig. 6 E ).

2021	PMC7836272	We next examined the long-term consequence of precocious centriole disengagement in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells.#####To this end, we codepleted Cep57 and Cep57L1 in HeLa cells for 96 h and observed the centriole number during mitosis.#####IF analysis revealed that ∼80% of the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells had more than four centrioles during mitosis (80.1 ± 9.0%;  n  = 50; from three independent experiments).#####In contrast, this was not the case for Cep57-depleted cells, in which centriole disengagement precociously occurred only in mitosis (siControl, 4.7 ± 3.6%; siCep57, 10.7% ± 1.3%;  Fig. 7, A and B ).#####This result suggests that the precociously disengaged centrioles, upon codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1, were already licensed to reduplicate during the interphase within the same cell cycle.#####This may have thereby led to the increase in the number of centrioles.#####To test this idea, we monitored the number of cartwheels using an HsSAS-6 marker.#####The Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with two pairs of engaged centrioles possessed two HsSAS-6 foci, as in control cells (siControl, 98.9 ± 1.9%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 93.3 ± 3.3%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 7, C and D ).#####On the other hand, more than half of the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four separate centrosomes had no HsSAS-6 foci in interphase (60.0 ± 6.7%;  Fig. 7, C and D ), suggesting that HsSAS-6 disappeared from the centrosomes, presumably concomitant with centriole disengagement.#####To further confirm this observation, we counted the number of HsSAS-6 foci in the S phase and in lovastatin-mediated G 1  arrest.#####In the S phase, the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four disengaged centrioles lack HsSAS-6 foci, in contrast to control cells, most of which possessed two HsSAS-6 foci ( Fig. S4, G and H ).#####However, in lovastatin-mediated G 1  arrest, HsSAS-6 was loaded onto centrioles with similar frequency in the control and Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells (siControl, 31.7 ± 0.4%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 35.2% ± 1.1%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. S4 I ).#####This result suggests that codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 did not suppress the initial recruitment of HsSAS-6 to the centriole.#####Considering these results, we assume that in the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, mother centrioles normally recruit HsSAS-6 to initiate daughter centriole formation, whereas HsSAS-6 is lost from centrioles, concomitantly with precocious centriole disengagement in the S phase.#####The previous studies also showed the absence of HsSAS-6 foci in the S phase upon Cep57 or Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion ( Zhao et al., 2020 ;  Wei et al., 2020 ), which is consistent with our observation.#####However, we speculate that those phenotypes might also be coupled with the precocious centriole disengagement rather than a defect in centriole duplication.#####Future investigations will be needed to clarify this point.

2021	PMC7836272	Interestingly, in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four HsSAS-6 foci, each HsSAS-6 focus was associated with a pair of centrioles ( Fig. 7 C ), which leads us to reason that the precociously disengaged centrioles newly acquired HsSAS-6 and reduplicated within the same cell cycle.#####To address this further, we performed live-cell imaging using the HeLa-GFP-centrin1 cell line and revealed that centriole reduplication occurred after the precocious centriole disengagement in interphase ( Fig. 7 E ).#####Intriguingly, we noticed that the earlier the precocious centriole disengagement occurred, the more frequently centriole reduplication could be observed ( Fig. 2 E ).#####In addition, live-cell imaging data revealed that the centrioles amplified by centriole reduplication could be inherited by the two daughter cells ( Fig. 7 E  and  Video 3 ).#####The inherited amplified centrioles could normally duplicate in the subsequent cell cycle, which further led to centrosome numerical abnormalities.#####Indeed, comparing the number of centrioles between 48 h and 96 h after the siRNA treatment, the numerical abnormalities were more significant at 96 h post-treatment ( Fig. 7 F ).#####Overall, these findings demonstrate that precocious centriole disengagement in interphase results in centrosome numerical abnormalities with each passing cell division due to continuous centriole reduplication and the inevitable inheritance of amplified centrioles by daughter cells.
2021	PMC7836272	Precocious centriole disengagement results in an increase in the number of centrioles.##### HeLa-GFP-centrin1 (green) cells were treated with siCep57 and siCep57L1.#####25 × 1.2–µm z-stacks were acquired every 10 min at 40× magnification.#####Image frames shown are maximum-intensity projections at each time point.
2021	PMC7836272	Because precocious centriole disengagement causes defects in chromosome segregation ( Watanabe et al., 2019 ), we then explored the fate of Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells in mitosis.#####We first grouped cells into four categories based on the timing of centriole disengagement and whether centriole reduplication occurred: normal (pattern 1), precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis (pattern 2), precocious centriole disengagement in interphase without centriole reduplication (pattern 3), and precocious centriole disengagement in interphase with centriole reduplication (pattern 4).#####To track centrioles and chromosomes in the mitotic cells, we performed live-cell imaging using the HeLa-GFP-centrin1 cell line and SiR-DNA, and we quantified the frequency of the phenotypes in each siRNA condition.#####In control cells or Cep57L1-depleted cells, two pairs of centrioles were engaged throughout the interphase and until the end of mitosis (pattern 1;  Fig. 8, A and B ;  Fig. S5 A ).#####Single depletion of Cep57 caused precocious centriole disengagement only in mitosis, but not in interphase (pattern 2;  Fig. 8, A and B ).#####As we mentioned above, most Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells exhibited precocious centriole disengagement in interphase (pattern 3), which was frequently followed by centriole reduplication (pattern 4;  Fig. 8, A and B ).#####These phenotypic patterns were consistent with what we had observed in the fixed cells ( Fig. S5, B and C ).#####We next quantified the frequency of chromosome segregation errors in each siRNA condition.#####Cep57- or Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells exhibited chromosome segregation errors, which were associated with chromosome misalignment and multipolar spindle formation (siControl, 0.7% ± 1.2%; siCep57, 15.3 ± 4.2%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 30.0 ± 2.0%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 8, C and D ; and  Video 4 ,  Video 5 ,  Video 6 , and  Video 7 ).#####The frequency of chromosome segregation errors in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells was about twice that in Cep57-depleted cells.#####To further investigate what factors most effectively led to the increase of the chromosome segregation errors in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, we next compared the frequency of chromosome segregation errors according to the phenotypic patterns.#####We revealed that Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with precocious centriole disengagement and centriole reduplication (pattern 4) showed the highest frequency of chromosome segregation errors (57.5 ± 8.0%;  Fig. 8, C and E ;  Fig. S5, D and E ).#####On the other hand, the frequency of chromosome segregation errors between the cells with precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis (pattern 2, in Cep57-depleted cells, 29.0 ± 8.0%) and interphase (pattern 3, in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, 34.8 ± 11.6%) were not significantly different ( Fig. 8 E ).#####These results suggest that, upon Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion, the centriole reduplication induced by precocious centriole disengagement in interphase is a more direct cause of chromosome segregation errors than the precocious centriole disengagement itself.

2021	PMC7836272	We next examined the long-term consequence of precocious centriole disengagement in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells.#####To this end, we codepleted Cep57 and Cep57L1 in HeLa cells for 96 h and observed the centriole number during mitosis.#####IF analysis revealed that ∼80% of the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells had more than four centrioles during mitosis (80.1 ± 9.0%;  n  = 50; from three independent experiments).#####In contrast, this was not the case for Cep57-depleted cells, in which centriole disengagement precociously occurred only in mitosis (siControl, 4.7 ± 3.6%; siCep57, 10.7% ± 1.3%;  Fig. 7, A and B ).#####This result suggests that the precociously disengaged centrioles, upon codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1, were already licensed to reduplicate during the interphase within the same cell cycle.#####This may have thereby led to the increase in the number of centrioles.#####To test this idea, we monitored the number of cartwheels using an HsSAS-6 marker.#####The Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with two pairs of engaged centrioles possessed two HsSAS-6 foci, as in control cells (siControl, 98.9 ± 1.9%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 93.3 ± 3.3%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. 7, C and D ).#####On the other hand, more than half of the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four separate centrosomes had no HsSAS-6 foci in interphase (60.0 ± 6.7%;  Fig. 7, C and D ), suggesting that HsSAS-6 disappeared from the centrosomes, presumably concomitant with centriole disengagement.#####To further confirm this observation, we counted the number of HsSAS-6 foci in the S phase and in lovastatin-mediated G 1  arrest.#####In the S phase, the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four disengaged centrioles lack HsSAS-6 foci, in contrast to control cells, most of which possessed two HsSAS-6 foci ( Fig. S4, G and H ).#####However, in lovastatin-mediated G 1  arrest, HsSAS-6 was loaded onto centrioles with similar frequency in the control and Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells (siControl, 31.7 ± 0.4%; siCep57/Cep57L1, 35.2% ± 1.1%;  n  = 30; from three independent experiments;  Fig. S4 I ).#####This result suggests that codepletion of Cep57 and Cep57L1 did not suppress the initial recruitment of HsSAS-6 to the centriole.#####Considering these results, we assume that in the Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells, mother centrioles normally recruit HsSAS-6 to initiate daughter centriole formation, whereas HsSAS-6 is lost from centrioles, concomitantly with precocious centriole disengagement in the S phase.#####The previous studies also showed the absence of HsSAS-6 foci in the S phase upon Cep57 or Cep57/Cep57L1 codepletion ( Zhao et al., 2020 ;  Wei et al., 2020 ), which is consistent with our observation.#####However, we speculate that those phenotypes might also be coupled with the precocious centriole disengagement rather than a defect in centriole duplication.#####Future investigations will be needed to clarify this point.

2021	PMC7836272	Interestingly, in Cep57/Cep57L1-depleted cells with four HsSAS-6 foci, each HsSAS-6 focus was associated with a pair of centrioles ( Fig. 7 C ), which leads us to reason that the precociously disengaged centrioles newly acquired HsSAS-6 and reduplicated within the same cell cycle.#####To address this further, we performed live-cell imaging using the HeLa-GFP-centrin1 cell line and revealed that centriole reduplication occurred after the precocious centriole disengagement in interphase ( Fig. 7 E ).#####Intriguingly, we noticed that the earlier the precocious centriole disengagement occurred, the more frequently centriole reduplication could be observed ( Fig. 2 E ).#####In addition, live-cell imaging data revealed that the centrioles amplified by centriole reduplication could be inherited by the two daughter cells ( Fig. 7 E  and  Video 3 ).#####The inherited amplified centrioles could normally duplicate in the subsequent cell cycle, which further led to centrosome numerical abnormalities.#####Indeed, comparing the number of centrioles between 48 h and 96 h after the siRNA treatment, the numerical abnormalities were more significant at 96 h post-treatment ( Fig. 7 F ).#####Overall, these findings demonstrate that precocious centriole disengagement in interphase results in centrosome numerical abnormalities with each passing cell division due to continuous centriole reduplication and the inevitable inheritance of amplified centrioles by daughter cells.

2019	PMC6389942	To determine whether Cep57 is a conserved factor across species, we first performed BLAST analysis.#####We succeeded in identifying a homologous 36 amino-acid (a.a.) sequence in the N-terminal coiled-coil region of Cep57 family proteins in vertebrates.#####The conserved sequence was also found in  T. cruzi .#####Unfortunately, our BLAST search did not hit any other invertebrate organisms presumably due to the short consensus sequence.#####Accordingly, we designated the conserved sequence the “PINC ( p resent  i n  N -terminus of  C ep57)” motif (Fig.  1a, b , Supplementary Fig.  1a ).#####Fig. 1 Cep57 is an evolutionarily conserved component and forms ring-like structures around the mother centriole wall.##### a  Schematic diagrams of  H. sapiens  Cep57 (HsCep57) and  T. cruzi  Cep57 (TcCep57).#####Coiled-coil domains are shown in gray box.#####The position of evolutionarily conserved domain (PINC motif) is indicated in pink line.##### b  Alignments of the evolutionarily conserved domain (PINC motif) within  H. sapiens ,  M. musculus ,  G. domesticus ,  X. laevis ,  D. rerio , and  T. cruzi .#####Identical residues determined by Clustal Omega are shown in red.#####Asterisks indicate the residues identical in all aligned sequences; colons: conserved substitutions; periods: semi-conserved substitutions.##### c  Centriolar distribution of Cep57 at different cell cycle stages.#####HeLa cells were immunostained with antibodies against Cep57 (red) and GT335 (green) and observed by STED microscopy.#####Scale bar, 1 μm.##### d  STED images representing top views of Cep57 and Cep192 at mother centrioles.#####Scale bar, 200 nm.##### e  The graph shows radial profiles from the center of the Cep57 and Cep192 rings.#####The obtained profile was then fitted with a Gaussian curve and the distance between the center of the ring and the peak of the Gaussian curve was defined as the radius.#####The diameter of the ring was defined as twice the radius.#####Values are mean distance ± s.d.#####( n  = 10).##### f  Cep57 becomes gradually enriched at new mother centrioles in interphase.#####HeLa cells were immunostained with antibodies against Cep57 and centrin-2.#####Arrowheads indicate new mother centrioles (OM old mother, NM new mother).#####Scale bar, 1 μm.##### g  The signal intensity of Cep57 at new mother centrioles is proportional to that of PCNT.#####HeLa cells were immunostained with antibodies against Cep57 and PCNT.#####Scale bar, 1 μm.##### h  Dot plots represent quantification of the signal intensity of Cep57 and PCNT at new mother centrioles ( n  = 36).##### i  HeLa cells co-expressing HA empty (control), HA-Cep57, or the indicated HA-Cep57 deletion mutants (1 μg) and Histone 2B-RFP (transfection control, 10 ng) were immunostained with antibodies against HA (green), Cep192 (cyan) and RFP (red).#####Scale bar, 5 μm in the low-magnified view, 1 μm in the inset

2019	PMC6389942	Next, to investigate the precise distribution of Cep57 at centrosomes across the cell cycle, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis with HeLa cells by using stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.#####STED analysis revealed that Cep57 formed ring-like structures around the proximal end of the mother centriole wall across the cell cycle (Fig.  1c ).#####We then sought to compare the diameter of centriolar rings of Cep57 with that of Cep192 rings that mark PCM.#####The diameter of the Cep57 ring was close to that of Cep192 (Cep57, 219.9 ± 13.9 nm; Cep192, 221.8 ± 18.5 nm; values are mean ± s.d.,  n  = 10), suggesting that Cep57 is a component of the inner layer of the PCM (Fig.  1d, e ).#####We also found that Cep57 was newly recruited to new mother centrioles gradually during the G1 phase, whereas Cep57 was confined to old mother centrioles just after cytokinesis and in early G1 (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Fig.  1b ).#####We noted that the difference between Cep57 signal intensities at old and new mother centrioles during the G1 phase was due to the difference in the height of Cep57 that bound along the side of the centriole wall (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Fig.  1c ).#####Furthermore, the signal intensity of Cep57 at new mother centrioles is proportional to that of PCNT, a major component of PCM (R 2  = 0.70), suggesting that both Cep57 and PCM components were simultaneously recruited around new mother centrioles in the G1 phase (Fig.  1g, h ).#####We next aimed to identify which domains of Cep57 are required for its centriolar localization.#####Consistent with previous reports 23 , the N-terminal half of the Cep57 fragment containing the first coiled-coil domain localized to centrioles.#####We further narrowed down the region required for centriolar localization of Cep57 in the first coiled-coil domain.#####Since secondary structure prediction analysis identified three discrete coiled-coil motifs in the first coiled-coil-enriched domain (Supplementary Fig.  1d ), we then constructed the deletion mutants that lack each coiled-coil motif.#####Whereas the two Cep57Δ120–160 and Cep57Δ187–239 deletion mutants localized to centrioles, a Cep57 deletion mutant lacking the PINC domain (Cep57Δ68–103) failed to localize to centrioles (Fig.  1i ).#####We also noted that overexpressed Cep57 occasionally localized to the filamentous microtubule network around the nucleus, which is consistent with previous reports 23 , 24  (Supplementary Fig.  1e ).#####Overall, these findings suggest that Cep57 is an evolutionarily conserved factor across species and localizes around the proximal part of the mother centriole wall.
2019	PMC6389942	To investigate the function of Cep57, we next depleted endogenous Cep57 using short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in HeLa cells, and found that depletion of Cep57 caused PCM disorganization (74.7 ± 3.8%, from three experiments) and precocious centriole disengagement (68.7 ± 2.5%, from three experiments) in mitotic cells (Fig.  2a–c ).#####We discriminated precocious centriole disengagement in Cep57-depleted cells when the distance between mother and daughter centrioles, in prometaphase or metaphase, was at least twice more than that of the control or interphase cells.#####In contrast, depletion of Cep57 did not lead to any defects in centriolar recruitment of Cep152, centriole duplication, and PCM organization in interphase cells (Supplementary Fig.  2a–c ).#####To ensure the two centrioles seen at the poles are the mother and daughter centriole pair, we tested ODF2 staining which marks mother centrioles and found a single ODF2-positive focus out of two separate centrioles at a spindle pole in Cep57-depleted cells (Supplementary Fig.  2d ).#####This observation indicates that the two centrioles seen at the pole are a pair of centrioles.#####The same mitotic defects were observed in different human cell lines (Supplementary Fig.  2e ) or when using siRNAs targeting different sequences of Cep57 ORF (Supplementary Fig.  2f ).#####The efficacy of Cep57 siRNA was confirmed using immunofluorescence analysis with specific antibodies against endogenous Cep57 (Supplementary Fig.  2g ).#####Furthermore, these defects were rescued by expressing RNAi-resistant full-length Cep57 constructs, indicating that the phenotypes observed were not due to the off-target effects of Cep57 siRNA (Supplementary Fig.  3a, b ).#####To further confirm the phenotypes upon depletion of Cep57, we also performed a live imaging of HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-centrin-1.#####In control cells, two pairs of engaged centrioles moved towards opposite poles of the cell during prophase–metaphase and lost their connection during late anaphase–cytokinesis.#####However, Cep57-depleted cells exhibited precocious centriole disengagement already in prophase (66.5 ± 2.1% from three experiments), as observed in fixed cells (Fig.  2d, f  and Supplementary Movies  1 ,  2 ).#####Interestingly, precociously disengaged centrioles dynamically moved around in the cell, which sometimes resulted in unequal distribution of centrioles (UDC) in daughter cells (10.0 ± 2.3% from three experiments; Fig.  2e, f , Supplementary Fig.  3c , Supplementary Movie  3 ).#####However, most of the Cep57-depleted cells showing the precocious disengagement phenotype still managed to form a bipolar spindle, presumably owing to centriole clustering, and divided into two daughter cells (Supplementary Fig.  3e ).#####Since we noticed that precociously disengaged daughter centrioles aberrantly acquired PCM components such as Cep192, CDK5RAP2, and GTU88 on their surroundings in mitosis, we hypothesized that precociously disengaged daughter centrioles acquire the ability to nucleate microtubules as MTOCs (Fig.  2a, g, i ).#####In line with this notion, we found that inhibition of centriole clustering by crenolanib 26  in Cep57-depleted cells induced multipolar spindles much more frequently (Supplementary Fig.  3d, e ).#####Crenolanib was reported to induce multipolar cell division in cancer cells with extra centrosomes by cofilin-mediated disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton 26 .#####Moreover, microtubule regrowth assay by cold treatment demonstrated that such precociously matured daughter centrioles obtained ectopic MTOC activity during mitosis (Fig.  2h, i ).#####These data suggest that Cep57 is critical for PCM integrity and centriole engagement, and also that ectopic MTOC activity of disengaged daughter centrioles, provoked by Cep57 depletion, may be deleterious to cells.#####Fig. 2 Cep57 is essential for centriole engagement and PCM organization in mitosis.##### a  HeLa cells were treated with siControl or siCep57 and immunostained with antibodies against centrin-2 (green) and Cep192 (red).#####Left–right arrows indicate precociously disengaged centrioles.##### b  Schematic model of the phenotype of Cep57 knockdown observed in  a .#####Depletion of Cep57 led to PCM disorganization and precocious centriole disengagement.##### c  Histograms represent frequency of mitotic cells with the indicated phenotypes observed in  a .#####Values are mean percentages ± s.d.#####from three independent experiments ( n  = 50 for each experiment).##### d  Time-lapse observation of cells upon Cep57 depletion.#####HeLa cells expressing GFP-centrin-1 were treated with siControl or siCep57 and observed in the presence of SiR-DNA (200 nM).#####Green and blue represent GFP-centrin-1 and DNA, respectively.#####Left–right arrows indicate precociously disengaged centrioles.#####Time zero corresponds to the beginning of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD).##### e  Time-lapse observation of unequal distribution of centrioles (UDC) in Cep57-depleted cells.#####Precociously disengaged centrioles move around in the cells, which sometimes results in UDC.#####Arrowheads indicate the precociously disengaged centriole moving toward the opposite spindle pole.##### f  Histograms represent frequency of the cells with the indicated phenotypes observed in  e .#####Values are mean percentages ± s.d.#####from three independent experiments (siControl  n  = 116, siCep57  n  = 119).##### g  Aberrant acquisition of PCM components of precociously disengaged daughter centrioles in Cep57-depleted cells.#####HeLa cells were immunostained with the indicated antibodies  h  Ectopic MTOC activity of precociously disengaged daughter centrioles in Cep57-depleted cells.#####HeLa cells were immunostained with antibodies against α-Tubulin (green) and CP110 (red).#####Arrowheads indicate the aberrant MTOC activity in Cep57-depleted mitotic cells.##### i  Schematic illustration of the phenotype of Cep57 knockdown observed in  g  and  h .#####Precociously disengaged daughter centrioles aberrantly acquire PCM components and MTOC activity.#####All scale bars, 5 μm in the low-magnified view, 1 μm in the inset.#####Two-tailed, unpaired Student’s  t -test was used in  c  and  f  to obtain  p  value.#####*#####* p  < 0.01

2019	PMC6389942	Given the above, we next examined the impact of Cep57 depletion on chromosome segregation in HeLa cells.#####Live-cell imaging showed that Cep57-depleted cells exhibited chromosomal segregation errors such as chromosome misalignment, chromosome lagging, and tripolar spindle formation (abnormal chromosome segregation 12.6%, compared to 2.6% in control cells, from three experiments), and also multi-nuclei formation (Fig.  3a, b , Supplementary Movies 4–6).#####Similar defects in chromosome segregation were observed in Cep57-depleted fixed cells (Supplementary Fig.  4a, b ).#####We noticed that, in the case of tripolar spindle formation, there were two types of mitotic cells with four or six centrioles (Supplementary Fig.  4a ).#####We assume that a tripolar spindle with six centrioles could arise from the occurrence of UDC and subsequent centriole duplication (Supplementary Fig.  4a ).#####On the other hand, a tripolar spindle with four centrioles was formed because of ectopic MTOC that the precociously disengaged daughter centriole assembled during mitosis (Supplementary Fig.  4a ).#####Moreover, chromosome misalignment, one of the major defects provoked by Cep57 depletion, was efficiently rescued by the expression of Cep57 (Supplementary Fig.  4c ).#####Taken together, Cep57 is crucial for genomic stability by governing PCM integrity and centriole engagement during mitosis.#####Fig. 3 Depletion of Cep57 or  cep57  mutations in MVA disease patients cause chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy.##### a  Chromosomal segregation errors observed in Cep57-depleted cells.#####HeLa GFP-centrin-1 cells were treated with siControl or siCep57 in the presence of SiR-DNA (200 nM).##### b  Histograms represent frequency of the mitotic cells with the indicated phenotypes in  a  (siControl  n   =  116, siCep57  n   =  119 from three independent experiments).##### c  Box-and-whiskers plots show the duration from NEBD to AO in  a .#####The ends of the box are the upper and lower quartiles.#####The median is marked by a vertical line inside the box (two independent experiments, siControl  n   =  86, siCep57  n   =  79).##### d  Pedigree of an MVA disease family.#####MVA patients 1 and 2 were affected with compound heterozygous  cep57  mutations, c.520_521delGA (p.E174fs) and c.915_925dup11 (p.H317fs).#####Their unaffected father and mother were the carriers of c.520_521delGA and c. 915_925dup11, respectively.##### e  MVA patients’ cells exhibited precocious centriole disengagement and PCM disorganization.#####MVA patients’ lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and their mother’s LCL (unaffected control) were immunostained with antibodies against centrin-2 (green) and Cep192 (red).#####Left–right arrows indicate precociously disengaged centrioles.##### f  Histograms represent frequency of the control and MVA patients’ cells with the indicated phenotypes in  e .#####Values are mean percentages ± s.d.#####from three independent experiments ( n   =  30 for each experiment).##### g  Abnormalities in centriole/centrosome number in MVA patients’ cells.#####MVA patients’ LCLs and their mother’s LCL were immunostained as in  e .##### h  Histograms represent frequency of the control and MVA patients’ cells with the indicated number of Cep192 foci in  g .#####Values are mean percentages ± s.d.#####from three independent experiments ( n   =  100 for each experiment).##### i  A model for the MVA disease with  cep57  mutations.#####Depletion of Cep57 or  cep57  mutations in MVA patients cause PCM disorganization and precocious centriole disengagement and thereby result in chromosomal segregation errors and aneuploidy.#####All scale bars, 5 μm in the low-magnified view, 1 μm in the inset.#####Mann–Whitney test was used in  c  to obtain  p  value.#####Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was used in  f  and  h  to obtain  p  value.#####*#####* p  < 0.01; NS not significantly different ( p  > 0.05)

2019	PMC6389942	A previous report showed that kinetochore-localized Cep57 is involved in spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and also that depletion of Cep57 causes an impairment of SAC function, and resulting premature onset of anaphase 21 .#####To judge whether such SAC impairment could cause chromosomal segregation errors, we quantified the time from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase onset (AO) upon depletion of Cep57.#####However, contrary to the previous report 21 , we could not observe a premature metaphase–anaphase transition and SAC deficiency in Cep57-depleted cells, even though we could observe kinetochore signals of Cep57 in control cells in a certain condition (Fig.  3c , Supplementary Fig.  4d ).#####We rather observe a delay in anaphase onset time in Cep57-depleted cells exhibiting chromosome misalignment or multipolar spindles because of ectopic MTOCs (Supplementary Fig.  4e ).#####To further address the effect of Cep57 on the SAC pathway, we measured mitotic duration under the nocodazole treatment.#####We found that depletion of Cep57 did not decrease mitotic duration, compared to the control cells, whereas depletion of Mad2 bypassed the SAC pathway and significantly shortened mitotic duration (Supplementary Fig.  4f ).#####Moreover, depletion of Cep57 did not reduce the kinetochore signal of Mad1 in HeLa cells treated with nocodazole and MG132 (Supplementary Fig.  4g, h ).#####We therefore reasoned that chromosomal segregation errors caused by Cep57 depletion in this condition are due to precocious centriole disengagement and PCM disorganization, rather than reduced SAC signaling.
2019	PMC6389942	We then tested if our finding in human culture cells is also true in MVA patients with biallelic reduction-of-function  cep57  mutations.#####To this end, we analyzed mitotic features of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from MVA patients (Fig.  3d–f , Supplementary Fig.  5a–c ).#####As expected, the MVA patients’#####LCLs also exhibited precocious centriole disengagement (40.0 ± 7.2% and 46.7 ± 7.2% in MVA1 and 2 patient cells, respectively) and PCM disorganization (17.8 ± 1.6% and 20.0 ± 9.8% in MVA1 and 2 patient cells, respectively) in mitosis (from three experiments, Fig.  3e, f , Supplementary Fig.  5d ).#####We also revealed that the number of Cep192 foci was often decreased or increased in MVA patients’ interphase cells, compared to control interphase cells that had two Cep192 foci (Fig.  3g, h , Supplementary Fig.  5d ).#####This could be due to UDC as was the case of Cep57-depleted cells.#####Overall, these findings strongly suggest that both Cep57 depletion and  cep57  mutations in MVA patients cause PCM disorganization and precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis, which results in chromosomal segregation errors and aneuploidy (Fig.  3i ).
2019	PMC6389942	To understand how Cep57 contributes to PCM organization and centriole engagement, we then searched for proteins directly binding to Cep57.#####Given that the cleavage of PCNT, a major PCM component, by separase is required for mitotic centriole disengagement 9 , 10 , and also the fact that, among major PCM components that we tested, depletion of PCNT only caused precocious centriole disengagement in early mitosis (Supplementary Fig.  6a, b ), we examined whether Cep57 physically interacts with PCNT.#####Remarkably, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in human HEK293T cells revealed this to be indeed the case (Fig.  4b ).#####Using co-IP assay with deletion constructs of Cep57, we narrowed down the Cep57 region required for PCNT-binding to the short stretch spanning a.a.#####68–103 (Fig.  4a, c ).#####Intriguingly, it turns out that this binding region contains the conserved PINC motif of Cep57, suggesting the importance of this interaction in centrosome biogenesis of various species.#####We next sought to identify the region of PCNT for binding to Cep57.#####First, by using co-IP analyses with PCNT truncate mutants, we found#####that short fragments of PCNT (a.a. 3139–3336 and a.a.#####2945–3216) were capable of binding to Cep57 (Fig.  4d, e ).#####These fragments contain the well-conserved PCNT/AKAP9 centrosomal targeting (PACT) domain of PCNT 27 .#####In contrast, the C-terminal fragment lacking the region of a.a.#####3139–3216 (PACT domain) failed to interact with Cep57 (Fig.  5a, b ).#####Since AKAP9 (also known as CG-NAP) also has the PACT domain, we then tested whether Cep57 interacts with the PACT domain of AKAP9.#####Co-IP analysis with the AKAP9 C-terminus (a.a.#####3643–3907) containing the PACT domain showed that Cep57 interacts with the PACT-containing short fragment of AKAP9 (Supplementary Fig.  6c ).#####Second, to confirm the interaction in vitro with the bacterially purified recombinant proteins, we purified Cep57 and PCNT fragments containing the interaction regions that were identified by co-IP experiments.#####We demonstrated that the two proteins interacted with each other by pull-down assays, suggesting the physical association between Cep57 and PCNT (Fig.  4f , Supplementary Fig.  6d ).#####We noted that the C-terminus PCNT recombinant protein lacking the region of a.a.#####3139–3216 (PACT domain) failed to interact with recombinant HA-Cep57, consistent with the binding data in cells (Supplementary Fig.  6d ).#####Pull-down assays also showed the direct interaction between Cep57 and AKAP9 (Supplementary Fig.  6e ).#####We also found that the Cep57–PCNT interaction was reproducibly detected by yeast two-hybrid assay (Supplementary Fig.  6f ).#####Third, to test whether Cep57 is a target of the PACT domain, we co-expressed HA-Cep57 and the GFP-PCNT C-terminus (a.a. 3113–3336) containing the PACT domain in human cells.#####The GFP-PCNT C-terminus, on its own, localized to centrioles and in the cytoplasm.#####In contrast, when the GFP-PCNT C-terminus was co-expressed with HA-Cep57, GFP-PCNT C-terminus co-localized with overexpressed Cep57 on microtubules as well as at centrioles (Fig.  4g ).#####These data suggest that the PCNT PACT domain is loaded onto microtubules due to its binding to overexpressed Cep57 that ectopically localizes to the microtubule network.#####As was the case of the GFP-PCNT C-terminus, the GFP-AKAP9 C-terminus (a.a.#####3643–3907) also co-localized with overexpressed Cep57 on microtubules (Fig.  4g ).#####Conversely, we tested whether loss of Cep57 affects centrosomal loading of the PACT.#####To address this, we overexpressed a GFP-PCNT fragment (a.a.#####3132–3226) containing the PACT domain in Cep57-depleted cells, and found that the GFP signal intensity at centrosomes was drastically decreased in response to Cep57 reduction (Fig.  4h, i ).#####Finally, we performed STED analysis to precisely test the co-localization of Cep57 and PCNT around centrioles.#####STED analysis with N- and C-terminal PCNT antibodies showed that Cep57 co-localized with the C-terminus of PCNT, but not with the N-terminus of PCNT in interphase (Supplementary Fig.  6g ).#####Similar observations were true for mitotic cells, and the C-terminus of PCNT co-localized with Cep57 in mitosis although the PCNT signal in mitosis is a bit fuzzy compared to that in interphase, probably due to PCM expansion.#####Collectively, these data demonstrate that Cep57 acts as an anchor for the PACT domain at centrioles.#####Fig. 4 Cep57 is an anchor of the PACT domain of PCNT.##### a  Schematic of Cep57 and the deletion mutants used for co-IP assays.#####Coiled-coil domains are shown in gray box;

2019	PMC6389942	Although we show that Cep57 is the direct interactor of the PACT domain of PCNT, Cep57 depletion slightly affected the loading of PCNT in interphase (Supplementary Fig.  8a, b ).#####We then assumed that the loading of PCNT is redundantly regulated in interphase.#####Indeed, we found the PCNT ΔPACT mutant which lacks Cep57-binding region still localized to centrioles through its C-terminus (Supplementary Fig.  8c ).#####We next searched for a new interactor responsible for the loading of PCNT in interphase.#####Importantly, we found that Cep152 interacted with the C-terminus of PCNT (but not with the PACT domain) and also that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of Cep152 significantly decreased the centriolar signal intensity of PCNT in interphase (Supplementary Fig.  8d–f ).#####Overexpression of CRISPR/Cas9-resistant GFP-Cep152 restored the PCNT signal at centrioles in the same condition, confirming the specificity of Cep152 guideRNA (Supplementary Fig.  8e, f ).#####These data indicate that Cep57 and Cep152, and perhaps other factors, redundantly regulate the loading of PCNT in interphase.
2019	PMC6389942	Importantly, we found that two mutations in the  PCNT  gene, K3154del mutation within the PACT domain and R2918X truncate mutation, which are responsible for microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 2 (MOPD2) disease 29 , 30 , drastically reduced the binding to Cep57, compared to wild-type PCNT (Fig.  5a–c ).#####This observation suggests that the disruption of the Cep57–PCNT interaction might be a cause of the MOPD2 disease, though we cannot officially rule out the possibility that the mutations also disrupt another protein–protein interaction.#####We next set out to examine the biological significance of the Cep57–PCNT interaction for PCM integrity and centriole engagement.#####To this end, we depleted endogenous PCNT using siRNA and expressed RNAi-resistant (RNAi-R) full-length or Cep57-binding-deficient mutants (PCNT ΔPACT or K3154del).#####All forms of PCNT were normally recruited to the centrosome in interphase (Supplementary Fig.  9a ).#####Whereas depletion of endogenous PCNT caused precocious centriole disengagement in mitosis, expression of the full-length PCNT functionally rescued this phenotype (Fig.  5d, e ).#####In contrast, the two binding-deficient mutants failed to rescue the phenotype provoked by depletion of endogenous PCNT (Fig.  5d, e ).#####Notably, these two mutants could not form PCM normally and caused PCM disorganization as observed in Cep57-depleted culture cells.#####These data suggest that the binding of PCNT to Cep57 at centrioles is required for the proper localization pattern of PCNT to organize the highly-ordered PCM structure and to maintain the centriole engagement during mitosis.#####In line with this notion, we established that depletion of Cep57 caused PCNT dispersion (Supplementary Fig.  9b ) and significantly shortened the height of PCNT that binds along the side of centriolar wall (Supplementary Fig.  9c, d ).#####Similarly, we sought to perform Cep57 knockdown-rescue experiments with Cep57 deletion mutant lacking the PCNT-binding domain; however, the PCNT-binding domain of Cep57 overlaps with its centriolar localization domain and the Cep57 mutant failed to localize to centrioles (Fig.  4c , Supplementary Fig.  1i ).#####As expected, we demonstrated that expression of the Cep57 mutant did not rescue the phenotype provoked by Cep57 depletion (Supplementary Fig.  9e ).
2019	PMC6389942	To further confirm the significance of the interaction, we next designed a PCNT chimera where the PACT domain was replaced with Cep57 (PCNT-Cep57 chimera) and performed PCNT knockdown-rescue experiments with the PCNT-Cep57 chimera construct (Fig.  5f ).#####Interestingly, this chimera mutant efficiently rescued the disengagement phenotype of PCNT depletion (Fig.  5g, h ).#####These data indicate that the Cep57–PCNT interaction is crucial for the function of PCNT at centrosomes and mitotic PCM organization (Fig.  6 ).#####Fig. 6 A speculative model for the role of Cep57 in centriole engagement and PCM integrity during mitosis.#####Cep57 localizes at the proximal ends of mother centrioles and directly binds to the PACT domain of PCNT.#####The binding of PCNT to Cep57 at centrioles is required for the proper localization pattern of PCNT to organize the highly ordered PCM structure and to maintain the centriole engagement during mitosis.#####In the absence of Cep57, the PCNT height that binds along the side of centriole wall is affected, which causes PCNT dispersion and PCM disorganization.#####PCM disorganization further leads to precocious centriole disengagement during mitosis.#####Precociously disengaged daughter centrioles aberrantly recruit PCM components and acquire ectopic MTOC activity, which thereby causes chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy

2019	PMC6472344	To obtain insights into the molecular basis of centriole duplication, we investigated the molecular properties of human Plk4.#####While performing in vitro biochemical experiments, we unexpectedly found that a kinase-dead (KD) mutant of a purified Plk4 fragment (Kinase + Linker 1) was highly insoluble compared with wild-type (WT) (Fig.  1a, b , Supplementary Fig.  1a ).#####Based on this observation, we speculated that Plk4 may modulate its solubility by autophosphorylation, because Plk4 is known to autophosphorylate its kinase domain and L1 14 , 16 , 18 – 21 .#####Recent studies have indicated that protein solubility can be regulated by multiple phosphorylation within the low-complexity region (LCR) 22 – 24 .#####Because human Plk4 contains an LCR in its disordered L1, we substituted some of the known and putative autophosphorylation sites in or around the LCR with alanine (10A) to generate a nonphosphorylatable mutant or with glutamic acid (10E) to generate a phosphomimetic mutant, as described previously 16 , 19  (Fig.  1c ).#####In line with this, the phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of Plk4 WT fragments was largely suppressed by the 10A mutation, suggesting that the target residues in WT fragments were phosphorylated in vitro (Supplementary Fig.  1b ).#####Fig. 1 Plk4 modulates its solubility by autophosphorylation in vitro.##### a  Disorder prediction and schematic of human Plk4 domains.#####Kinase kinase domain, L1/L2 Linker 1/2, LCR low complexity region, CPB Cryptic Polo-box, PB Polo-box.##### b  Image of 500 nM Plk4 (Kinase + L1)-His 6  fragments after GST-tag cleavage by PreScission protease.#####This truncated form was used for in vitro experiments to directly examine the function of L1 in Plk4 condensation.##### c  Amino acid sequence of low complexity region (288–303 a.a.) and its neighboring region of human Plk4.#####Red letters, mutation sites; Gray background, degron motif.##### d  Spin-down assay.#####After GST-tag cleavage, 500 nM Plk4 (Kinase + L1)-His 6  solution was centrifuged and separated into supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions.#####Representative gel stained with CBB and the quantification are shown.#####Graph represents mean percentages ± SD of the pellet fraction from three independent experiments.#####NaCl, 500 mM.  e  Measurement of the light scattering of GST-Plk4 (Kinase + L1)-His 6  (100 μg/ml) under thermal control.#####Left: Representative data of three independent experiments.#####Values were normalized to the scattering at 25 °C.#####Dotted vertical lines indicate each aggregation onset temperature.#####Right: Aggregation onset temperature.#####Graph shows mean temperature ± SD from three independent experiments.##### f  Measurement of protein aggregation of 300 nM GST-Plk4 (Kinase + L1)-His 6  by Proteostat aggregation assay.#####Fluorescence values were normalized to the WT.#####Graph shows mean ± SD from three independent experiments.##### g  Dephosphorylation assay.#####GST-His 6  and GST-Plk4(Kinase + L1)-His 6  (100 μg/ml) were incubated with λPP at 30 °C for the indicated time and each light scattering was measured.#####Representative data of three independent experiments.##### h  Schematic of in vitro solubility of Plk4.#####Source data are provided as a  Source Data  file

2019	PMC6472344	To assess the solubility of purified Plk4 fragments in vitro, we performed a spin-down assay and showed that Plk4 WT fragments were mostly soluble, whereas the KD mutant was largely insoluble (Fig.  1d , Supplementary Fig.  1c  and  1d ).#####As expected, the 10A mutant of the Plk4 fragment was mainly detected in the insoluble fraction, unlike the WT.#####In contrast, adding the 10E mutation in the KD mutant (KD10E) improved the solubility of the Plk4 fragments compared with the KD mutant.#####We also monitored the light scattering of purified GST-Plk4(Kinase + L1)-His 6  in solution as an indicator of protein aggregation under thermal control.#####When the temperature was increased, all the Plk4 fragments increased their light scattering but exhibited the onset of scattering at different temperatures (Fig.  1e , Supplementary Fig.  1e ).#####Compared with the WT, the KD and 10A mutants started scattering at lower temperatures.#####Adding the 10E mutation to the KD mutant shifted the onset of scattering to a higher temperature, than that of the KD mutant.#####In addition, dephosphorylation of the WT fragment by adding λ-phosphatase (λPP) significantly increased the scattering over time (Fig.  1g ), demonstrating that phosphorylation of Plk4 prevents Plk4 aggregation.#####Furthermore, we confirmed the aggregation properties of Plk4 in vitro using the Proteostat dye, which fluoresces after being incorporated into insoluble protein aggregates.#####Similarly, KD, 10A, and λPP-treated WT Plk4 fragments showed considerable protein aggregation compared with WT and the other mutants (Fig.  1f , Supplementary Fig.  1f  and  1g ).#####Because it appeared that the 10A and 10E mutations did not completely mimic the KD and constitutively phosphorylated states of Plk4, respectively, it is possible that phosphorylation at other sites may also cooperatively regulate the solubility of that Plk4 proteins or amino-acid substitution might affect the natural self-assembly processes 25 , 26 .#####Taken together, we conclude that autophosphorylation of Plk4 regulates not only its protein degradation in cells but also its solubility by modulating its self-aggregating properties (Fig.  1h ).
2019	PMC6472344	It has been shown that some proteins self-assemble into macromolecular structures such as spheres, networks, and fibrils which are linked to their physiological functions 27 , 28 .#####To characterize Plk4 self-assembly further, we visualized purified Plk4 fragments (Kinase + L1) and full-length Plk4 by labeling with GFP and mScarlet I, respectively.#####Intriguingly, we found that the Plk4 fragments (Kinase + L1) form condensates in a crowded environment (8% poly-ethylene glycol (PEG)) (Fig.  2a , Supplementary Fig.  2a–d ).#####Importantly, such structures were barely detectable for the Kinase domain alone, suggesting that L1 domain confers condensation property of the Plk4 fragments.#####Furthermore, the KD and the nonphosphorylatable mutant of GFP-Plk4 fragments (Kinase + L1) exhibited condensates in a lower (2–4%) PEG environment, compared with the WT (Fig.  2a , Supplementary Fig.  2d ).#####This was also true for the full length Plk4 WT and KD (Fig.  2b , Supplementary Fig.  2e–g ).#####These results suggest that Plk4 has an intrinsic ability to self-assemble into condensates and that the condensation properties are regulated by autophosphorylation in vitro.#####Fig. 2 Condensation properties of Plk4 are regulated by autophosphorylation.##### a  Representative images of 70 nM GFP-Plk4 (Kinase) and GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1) in the presence of PEG.#####Scale bar, 2 μm.##### b  Representative images of 40 nM mScarlet I-Plk4 (Full length) in the presence of PEG.#####Scale bar, 2 μm.##### c  HeLa cells expressing GFP-Plk4 (Kinase) and GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1).#####Cells were treated with DMSO or 100 nM Centrinone (20 h).#####Scale bar, 10 μm; inset, 2 μm.##### d  Fusion event of GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1)-induced cytoplasmic condensates.#####Scale bar, 2 μm.##### e ,  f  FRAP analysis of cytoplasmic GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1) condensates ( e ) and centriolar GFP-Plk4 (Full length) ( f ) in HeLa cells ( n  = 10 and 15 cells, respectively).#####Cells were treated with DMSO, 100 nM centrinone, 10 μM MG132 or 10 μM MLN4924 for 5–6 h respectively.##### g  Amino acid sequence of mutation sites in Plk4.#####Red letters, mutation sites; Gray background, degron motif.##### h ,  i  FRAP analysis of cytoplasmic GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1) mutant condensates ( h ) and centriolar GFP-Plk4 (Full length) mutants ( i ) in HeLa cells ( n  = 15 cells for each experiment).#####For  e ,  f ,  h ,  i , intensities were normalized with the average of three pre-bleach signals.#####Graph shows mean ± SD from two ( e ) or three ( f ,  h ,  i ) independent experiments.#####Scale bar, 1 μm.##### j  Schematic of the material properties of Plk4 regulated by autophosphorylation.#####Source data are provided as a  Source Data  file

2019	PMC6472344	We next asked whether Plk4 also self-assembles in cells.#####We overexpressed the Plk4 (Kinase + L1) fragments in HeLa cells and found that depending on the degree of its expression level, the Plk4 fragments self-assemble into spherical structures (Fig.  2c , Supplementary Fig.  3a ).#####In these structures, known Plk4 interactors such as Cep152 and STIL, were hardly detectable, suggesting that this system is suitable for specific validation of Plk4 self-assembly in cells (Supplementary Fig.  3e ).#####Importantly, consistent with in vitro observation of the purified Plk4 proteins, expression of the kinase domain alone did not induce such structures, demonstrating the dependency on the L1 domain for self-condensation (Fig.  2c , Supplementary Fig.  3a ).#####The Plk4 condensates fused and exhibited dynamic turnover (Fig.  2d, e ).#####We also observed similar behavior of the cytoplasmic condensates induced by overexpressing full length Plk4 (Supplementary Fig.  3b–d ).#####Thus, these results suggest that Plk4 has an ability to assemble into liquid-like condensates in cells.#####We also noticed that centrinone-treatment which specifically inhibits Plk4 kinase activity induced irregular, non-spherical assemblies (Fig.  2c ), implying some changes of condensation properties of Plk4 depending on its kinase activity.
2019	PMC6472344	To reveal the significance of autophosphorylation for Plk4 condensation in cells, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis with HeLa cells expressing GFP-Plk4.#####In control cells, cytoplasmic condensates of the Plk4 fragments (Kinase + L1) showed dynamic turnover (Fig.  2e ).#####Intriguingly, we found that inhibition of Plk4 kinase activity with centrinone, but not inhibition of its protein degradation by MG132 (an inhibitor of proteasomes) or MLN4924 (an inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme that activates SCF-cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase) treatment, significantly impaired the Plk4 turnover (Fig.  2e ), although all of these inhibitors similarly increased the amount of endogenous Plk4 at centrioles (Supplementary Fig.  4a ).#####Importantly, the dynamics of full length Plk4 at centrioles exhibited similar dynamics depending on its kinase activity (Fig.  2f ), suggesting that Plk4 condenses at centrioles likewise.#####From these results, we assumed that centriolar dynamics of condensed Plk4 are regulated by its kinase activity rather than by local protein degradation.#####Next, we tested whether introducing nonphosphorylatable mutations to Plk4 affects the dynamics of Plk4 condensates.#####Consistent with the effects of the inhibitor treatment, KD, 10A, and 13A mutations, but not 2A mutation (in the DSG phospho degron motif 16 , 20 ), attenuated Plk4 turnover both in the cytoplasmic condensates and at centrioles (Fig.  2g–i , Supplementary Fig.  4b  and  4c ).#####We also confirmed the differences of condensation properties between Plk4 mutants using the plasma membrane tethering assay (Supplementary Fig.  5a–c ).#####Together with the in vitro data, these results indicate that the dynamics of condensed Plk4 changes depending on its autophosphorylation state (Fig.  2j ).#####We speculate that the autophosphorylation-regulated condensation properties of Plk4 may be conserved across species, because we found that  Drosophila  Plk4 (Dm Plk4) exhibited similar behaviors in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig.  6a–e ).
2019	PMC6472344	We further analyzed the correlation between Plk4 condensation properties and centriolar Plk4 dynamics.#####We made several alanine mutants of Plk4 (6A, 7A, 8A1, 8A2, 9A) and found that by changing the number of alanine mutations, the dynamics of cytoplasmic Plk4 condensates was gradually altered (Fig.  3a, b ).#####Importantly, centriolar Plk4 dynamics was also gradually suppressed in concert with an increase in the number of alanine mutations (Fig.  3c ).#####These results further support the notion that centriolar Plk4 dynamics is critically dependent on its condensation properties.#####Fig. 3 Condensation properties of Plk4 regulate centriolar copy number.##### a  Amino acid sequence of mutation sites in Plk4.#####Red letters, mutation sites; Gray background, degron motif.##### b  FRAP analysis of cytoplasmic GFP-Plk4 (Kinase + L1) condensates ( b ) and centriolar GFP-Plk4 (Full length) ( c ) in HeLa cells ( n  = 12 and 13 cells, respectively).#####For  b  and  c , intensities were normalized with the average of three pre-bleach signals.#####Graph shows mean ± SD from two ( b ) or three ( c ) independent experiments.##### d  Centriole over-duplication assay.#####Plk4 (Full length)-3xFLAG was exogenously expressed under the CMV mutant promoter in siPlk4-treated HeLa cells.#####Cells were transfected with siRNA (24 h) and then with plasmid (48 h).#####Cells were stained with anti-CP110 antibodies as a centriole marker.#####Scale bar, 10 μm; inset, 2 μm.#####Percentages of cells which have >4 CP110 foci were calculated.#####Graph represents mean percentages ± SD (siControl  n  = 146, siPlk4 + Emp  n  = 159, siPlk4 + WT  n  = 153, siPlk4 + 6A  n  = 153, siPlk4 + 7A  n  = 166, siPlk4 + 8A1  n  = 155, siPlk4 + 8A2  n  = 148, siPlk4 + 9A  n  = 151, siPlk4 + 10A  n  = 157, siPlk4 + KD  n  = 151 cells) from three independent experiments.##### e  Summary of the correlation between the condensed Plk4 dynamics and frequencies of centriole overduplication.#####Source data are provided as a  Source Data  file

2019	PMC6472344	We next investigated whether the regulated condensation of Plk4 is involved in proper centriole duplication.#####In human cells, exogenous overexpression of Plk4 under a strong promoter such as CMV (cytomegalovirus) induces centriole overduplication 5 , 16 .#####To express the Plk4 mutants in HeLa cells at levels comparable to endogenous expression, we utilized the CMV mutant promoter (see Methods).#####As expected, in this condition, expression of Plk4-3xFLAG WT rarely induced centriole overduplication (Fig.  3d , Supplementary Fig.  7a  and  7b ).#####In contrast, expression of the Plk4 alanine mutants led to centriole overduplication in the same condition.#####Intriguingly, by introducing alanine mutations to be less dynamic and promote condensation, frequencies of centriole overduplication were significantly enhanced (Fig.  3d, e ).#####This close correlation strongly suggests that condensation properties of Plk4 are implicated in the regulation of centriole copy number and also that the condensation state of Plk4 at centrioles must be appropriately controlled by its autophosphorylation.#####Overall, we conclude that autophosphorylation of Plk4 regulates not only its degradation but also its condensation and dynamics at centrioles, which is most likely involved in tight control of the centriole copy number.
2019	PMC6472344	Our results raised the possibility that the regulated condensation of Plk4 is a key factor for determining a single daughter duplication site.#####To further investigate how Plk4 condensation regulates its centriolar localization and centriole duplication, we first analyzed the spatial patterning of endogenous Plk4 during centriole duplication.#####Recently, we reported that Plk4 forms a biased ring in G1 phase before centriolar loading of STIL-HsSAS6 9 , 29 .#####We then confirmed that in G1 phase, Plk4 formed a ring-like structure with an intense focus (Fig.  4a, b ).#####Thereafter, Plk4 changed its localization pattern to a single focus that colocalized with STIL and HsSAS6 in G1/S phase, as reported previously 9 , 30  (Fig.  4b ).#####Next, to monitor autophosphorylation of Plk4 in cells, we generated the specific antibody against phosphorylated serine 305 (pS305) of Plk4 in this study 19 , 29  (Supplementary Fig.  8a–d ).#####After mitosis, as Plk4 signals at centrioles were increased, Plk4pS305 signals started to be detected and simultaneously increased before the loading of STIL-HsSAS6 (Fig.  4c , Supplementary Fig.  9a–c ).#####Strikingly, structural illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed that even in cells with a ring-like distribution of Plk4, Plk4pS305 appeared as a single focus around mother centrioles (Fig.  4b ).#####In addition, the Plk4pS305 signal overlapped with the intense focus of Plk4 rings (Fig.  4b , Supplementary Fig.  10a ).#####Consistent with this, even in cells in which HsSAS6 had not yet been loaded to the centrioles, the Plk4pS305 signals were already patterned as a single focus around mother centrioles (Fig.  4d ).#####After HsSAS6 loading, the Plk4pS305 signals colocalized with HsSAS6 as a focus (Fig.  4d ).#####Thus, these results demonstrate that, before procentriole formation, distribution of autophosphorylated Plk4 is already biased around mother centrioles, which could provide the assembly site of procentrioles.#####Furthermore, even in cells depleted of STIL and HsSAS6 (siSTIL and siHsSAS6-treated), the Plk4pS305 signal was localized as a single focus around mother centrioles (Supplementary Fig.  10b–e ), further confirming that the occurrence of Plk4 phosphorylation is independent of the presence of STIL-HsSAS6 and is likely dependent on the intrinsic properties of Plk4.#####Fig. 4 A single focus of autophosphorylated Plk4 is generated prior to STIL-HsSAS6 loading.##### a  Schematic of Plk4 distribution around mother centrioles in centriole duplication.##### b  3D-SIM images of centrioles immunostained with the indicated antibodies in HeLa cells.#####Cep152 was costained and used for a marker of mother centriole wall.#####Scale bar, 0.3 μm.##### c  Quantification of centriolar Plk4, Plk4pS305, STIL, and HsSAS6 intensities during G1 phase.#####Cells were synchronized with thymidine and nocodazole.#####Mitotic cells were collected and released from nocodazole.#####Intensities were normalized with the average intensity at 9 h after nocodazole washout.#####Graph shows mean ± SD of centriolar intensities (For each time point (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 h), Plk4  n  = 94, 92, 99, 106, 108, and 102 centrioles, Plk4pS305  n  = 94, 92, 99, 106, 108, and 102 centrioles, STIL  n  = 72, 91, 97, 92, 98, and 103 centrioles, HsSAS6  n  = 99, 100, 102, 107, 103, and 102 centrioles) from two independent experiments.#####See also Supplementary Fig.  9 .##### d  3D-SIM images of centrioles immunostained with antibodies against HsSAS6, Plk4pS305, and Cep152 in HeLa cells.#####Relative intensities of each protein were quantified along Cep152 ring and maximum peaks of Plk4pS305 intensity were set to 0°.#####Intensities were normalized to each maximum intensity.#####Graph shows mean intensities ± SD ( n  = 11 and 10 centrioles, respectively).#####Scale bar, 0.3 μm.##### e ,  f  HeLa cells were transfected with siPlk4 and siHsSAS6 (24 h) and then transfected with plasmid (26 h) expressing Plk4-3xFLAG under the CMV mutant promoter.#####After plasmid transfection, cells were arrested at G1 phase with Lovastatin (10 μM, 20 h).##### e  Quantification of centriolar Plk4pS305 intensities in cells expressing Plk4-3xFLAG WT or 7A.#####Black bars indicate average intensities ( n  = 54 and 53 centrioles, respectively).#####Intensities were normalized with the average intensity of the WT.#####Representative data of two experiments.#####**** p  < 0.0001 (Mann–Whitney  U  test).##### f  Representative images of centrioles immunostained with the indicated antibodies.#####Images were obtained by TCS SP8 HSR system with deconvolution.#####Scale bar, 0.3 μm.#####Source data are provided as a  Source Data  file

2019	PMC6472344	To examine whether condensation properties of Plk4 are involved in the autophosphorylation state of Plk4 at centrioles, we utilized Plk4 7A mutant that is less-dynamic, due to its promoted condensation property, and recognized by anti-Plk4pS305 antibodies (Fig.  3a–c ).#####Intriguingly, cells expressing Plk4-3xFLAG 7A under the CMV mutant promoter led to higher amount of Plk4pS305 at centrioles, frequently with a uniform ring structure around mother centrioles (Fig.  4e, f ).#####This result suggests that condensation properties of Plk4 are involved in spatial organization of autophosphorylated Plk4 at centrioles.#####We also found that overexpression of Plk4 WT (under CMV promoter) induced a uniform ring-like structure of Plk4pS305 around the mother centriole, suggesting that Plk4 over-condensation induced by its overexpression promoted autonomous activation on the mother centriole wall (Supplementary Fig.  10e ).#####Thus, these data together support the notion that self-condensation of endogenous Plk4 should be properly regulated to ensure a single focus of autophosphorylated Plk4 around mother centrioles, which presumably limits STIL-HsSAS6 loading to the single assembly site for procentrioles.
2019	PMC6472344	Our results thus far demonstrated that Plk4 is autophosphorylated before STIL-HsSAS6 loading, raising the possibility that autonomous activation of Plk4, as a consequence of Plk4 condensation, drives centriolar loading of STIL-HsSAS6 for the initiation of procentriole formation.#####To address this, we monitored the time course of Plk4 autophosphorylation and STIL-HsSAS6 loading in cells transiently treated with centrinone at G1 phase.#####We first inhibited the kinase activity of Plk4 by centrinone treatment in G1-arrested HeLa cells and subsequently released the inhibition by washout of centrinone (Fig.  5a ).#####We found that transient centrinone treatment was sufficient to remove the Plk4pS305 signal from centrioles, whereas Plk4 itself significantly accumulated at centrioles (Fig.  5b, c , Supplementary Fig.  11a–e ).#####As previously reported 11 , 29 , centrinone treatment induced displacement of STIL-HsSAS6 from centrioles, indicating that Plk4 kinase activity is required for centriolar localization of the STIL-HsSAS6 complex (Fig.  5b, c , Supplementary Fig.  11a–e ).#####After washout of centrinone, accumulation of Plk4pS305 and STIL-HsSAS6 signals at centrioles began almost simultaneously and increased gradually in most cells (Fig.  5b, c , Supplementary Fig.  11a–e ).#####Importantly, even in HsSAS6-depleted cells (siHsSAS6-treated), the autophosphorylated Plk4 (pS305) signal was increased after washout of centrinone, as observed in control cells (siControl-treated) (Fig.  5b–d , Supplementary Fig.  11a–e ), indicating that autophosphorylation of Plk4 occurs in Plk4 condensates independently of centriolar loading of the STIL-HsSAS6 complex.#####In contrast, as reported previously 31 , depletion of HsSAS6 suppressed centriolar loading of STIL (Fig.  5c ).#####Unexpectedly, in this condition, the thickened Plk4 ring did not return to the original state after washout of centrinone (Supplementary Fig.  11e ).#####As a possible reason, we assume that once completely-inactivated Plk4 proteins assemble into less dynamic aggregates upon centrinone treatment, these aggregates trap autophosphorylated Plk4 in the structures without rapid dissociation (Supplementary Fig.  8d ).#####Taken together, our results suggest that (1) autonomous activation of Plk4 within the Plk4 ring occurs in G1 phase, (2) Plk4 activation is mediated by its condensation properties, and (3) Plk4 activation subsequently drives centriolar loading of the STIL-HsSAS6 complex by phosphorylating STIL.#####Fig. 5 Autonomous activation of Plk4 that stems from Plk4 self-condensation drives centriolar loading of STIL-HsSAS6.##### a  Scheme of the experimental condition.#####G1-arrested HeLa cells (10 μM Lovastatin (Lov) (see also Supplementary Fig.  11 )) were treated with 100 nM centrinone (Cent) and then washed out (WO) the centrinone.#####Cells were continuously treated with Lovastatin after centrinone washout.##### b ,  c  Representative images of immunostained HsSAS6 and Plk4pS305 ( b ), STIL and Plk4 ( c ) in the indicated condition.#####Scale bar, 1 μm.#####Quantification data show centriolar Plk4pS305, HsSAS6, STIL, and Plk4 intensities in the indicated condition.#####Gray and pink dots represent the data from siControl and siHsSAS6-treated cells, respectively.#####Black bars show mean values (for Plk4pS305 and HsSAS6: siControl  n  = 166, 161, 171, 154, and 160 centrioles, siHsSAS6  n  = 102, 105, 118, 100, and 111 centrioles) (for STIL and Plk4: siControl  n  = 152, 141, 138, 144, and 138 centrioles, siHsSAS6  n  = 109, 96, 104, 105, and 102 centrioles) from two independent experiments.#####Intensities were normalized to the average intensity of the siControl Centrinone (−) condition.##### d  Schematic summary of the correlation between centriolar phospho-Plk4 (pS305) and STIL-HsSAS6 intensity.#####Source data are provided as a  Source Data  file

2021	PMC7812875	To understand the functions of PCM in bipolar spindle formation, we depleted the main components of PCM, such as CEP192, pericentrin, and CDK5RAP2, and observed bipolar spindle assembly in HeLa, A549, and RPE1 cells.#####As previously described, the depletion of CEP192 caused severe defects in bipolar spindle formation and prolonged mitotic duration ( Fig. 1, A and B ;  Fig. S3 ;  Videos 1  and  2 ).#####On the other hand, double depletion of pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 or their individual depletion had a limited effect on mitotic duration in HeLa cells ( Fig. 1, A and B ;  Fig. 2 C ;  Fig. S1 G ;  Videos 1 ,  3 ,  15 ,  17 , and  18 ) and bipolar spindle assembly in RPE1 and A549 cells ( Fig. S3, A–D ).#####These results suggest that CEP192, but not pericentrin or CDK5RAP2, is critical for mitotic progression.#####It has been suggested that pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 cooperatively recruit PCM components, including CEP192, at centrosomes ( Kim and Rhee, 2014 ).#####Therefore, we observed the amount and localization of CEP192 at centrosomes upon depletion of pericentrin and CDK5RAP2.#####We found that a certain quantity of CEP192 remained at centrosomes in pericentrin/CDK5RAP2 double-depleted cells ( Fig. 1, C and D ).#####To further understand this mechanism, we used gated stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to analyze the detailed localization pattern of CEP192 at centrosomes in pericentrin/CDK5RAP2 double-depleted cells ( Fig. 1, E–G ).#####Centrioles were marked by polyglutamylated centriolar microtubules.#####In control cells, CEP192 was detectable in the PCM clouds that surrounded mother centrioles ( Fig. 1, E–G ).#####In contrast, in pericentrin/CDK5RAP2 double-depleted cells, the reduced quantity of CEP192 was detectable only on centriolar walls.#####These results raise the possibility that CEP192 at the centriolar wall, rather than in the PCM cloud, is crucial for the microtubule-organizing center function of centrosomes.

2021	PMC7812875	To understand the functions of PCM independently of centrioles in human cells, we next induced the formation of mitotic spindles with one or zero centrosomes by treating HeLa cells with the PLK4 inhibitors centrinone or centrinone B ( Fig. 2, A and B ).#####Centrosomes were marked by polyglutamylated centriolar microtubules or centrin to determine their number.#####We depleted PCM components CEP192, pericentrin, and CDK5RAP2 in one- or zero-centrosome cells and observed their mitotic progression using live-cell imaging.#####As described above, the depletion of CEP192, but not pericentrin or CDK5RAP2, prolonged mitosis in cells with two centrosomes ( Fig. 2 C ;  Fig. S1 A–G ;  Videos 15 ,  16 ,  17 , and  18 ).#####On the other hand, interestingly, we found that depletion of pericentrin or CDK5RAP2, as well as CEP192, significantly prolonged mitotic duration in one-centrosome cells ( Fig. 2 D ;  Fig. S1 H ;  Videos 19 ,  20 ,  21 , and  22 ).#####In contrast, we found that depletion of pericentrin, CDK5RAP2, or CEP192 had a limited effect on mitotic progression in zero-centrosome cells ( Fig. 2 E ;  Fig. S1 I ;  Videos 23 ,  24 ,  25 , and  26 ).#####These results suggest that pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 are important for mitotic progression in one-centrosome cells, but not in two- or zero-centrosome cells.
2021	PMC7812875	We further analyzed the localization patterns of PCM proteins at spindle poles using immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy ( Fig. 2, F and G ; and  Fig. S2, A–D ).#####We found that the acentriolar spindle poles of one-centrosome cells incorporate a detectable amount of PCM components, such as pericentrin, CDK5RAP2, CEP192, and γ-tubulin ( Fig. 2, F and G ; and  Fig. S2 A ), but not CEP152 or CPAP ( Figs. 2 G  and  S2 A ).#####In this study, we termed the acentriolar spindle pole that contains PCM the “PCM pole.#####” In contrast, most spindle poles of zero-centrosome cells lacked PCM components, as previously described ( Fig. 2, F and G ;  Fig. S2 A ;  Chinen et al., 2020 ).#####PCM components were consistently detectable at the acentriolar spindle poles in one-centrosome cells of various human cell lines ( Fig. S2 B ).#####Furthermore, the PCM pole was similarly observed in one-centrosome cells induced by SAS6 depletion using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system ( Fig. S2, C and D ;  Yoshiba et al., 2019 ), suggesting that this phenotype was not a specific result of PLK4 inhibition.

2021	PMC7812875	We next examined whether the PCM pole nucleates microtubules using a microtubule regrowth analysis.#####For this analysis, we immunostained the microtubule end binding protein 1 (EB1), which marks growing microtubule plus ends.#####When restarting the microtubule nucleation, the EB1 signals started developing around both centriolar and PCM poles, with PCM poles nucleating fewer microtubules ( Fig. S2 E ).#####Thus, PCM poles possess microtubule nucleation activity, although this activity appears slightly lower than that of centriolar poles.#####Collectively, these results suggest that one-centrosome cells assemble PCM at the acentriolar spindle pole, which harbors microtubule nucleation activity ( Fig. 2 H ).
2021	PMC7812875	To understand the mechanism of PCM recruitment to the acentriolar pole in one-centrosome cells, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to track the dynamics of endogenous pericentrin or CDK5RAP2 tagged with mCherry as markers of PCM.#####This strategy revealed that, at first, pericentrin accumulated at centriolar poles in early mitosis.#####Subsequently, one-centrosome cells formed pericentrin-positive PCM poles by either splitting of the PCM from the centriolar pole or de novo accumulation of PCM (38.5% and 51.9%, respectively;##### Fig. 3, A, B, and D ;  Videos 4 ,  5 , and  6 ).#####These PCM poles disappeared after cytokinesis ( Fig. 3, A, B, and E ;  Videos 4 ,  5 , and  6 ), consistent with the observation that PCM proteins are disassembled after mitotic exit ( Woodruff et al., 2014 ).#####On the other hand, a detectable amount of pericentrin did not accumulate at the acentriolar spindle poles in most zero-centrosome cells ( Fig. 3, C and D ;  Video 7 ).#####Taken together, these observations suggest that one-centrosome cells initially accumulate PCM proteins around centrioles and subsequently generate the acentriolar pole by splitting and/or recruiting PCM components on the opposite side for bipolar spindle formation ( Fig. 3 F ).

2021	PMC7812875	We next analyzed the specific role of PCM in cell division in one-centrosome cells.#####However, it is difficult to analyze the functions of some PCM pole components in this context.#####Among those appeared to localize at PCM poles ( Fig. 2, F and G ; and  Fig. S2 A ), for example, γ-tubulin also localizes along the whole spindle and regulates several pathways of microtubule nucleation in mitosis ( Lecland and Lüders, 2014 ;  Teixidó-Travesa et al., 2012 ).#####In addition, CEP192 is required for bipolar spindle formation in cells with two centrosomes ( Zhu et al., 2008 ;  Joukov et al., 2014 ).#####On the other hand, depletion of the PCM scaffold proteins CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin are known to have little effect on spindle formation in two- or zero-centrosome cells ( Fig. 2, C–E ;  Fig. S1, G–I ;  Videos 15 ,  17 ,  18 ,  23 ,  25 , and  26 ).#####Therefore, we selected CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin for further analysis of PCM poles in one-centrosome cells.
2021	PMC7812875	We found that depletion of CDK5RAP2 or pericentrin caused arrest of one-centrosome cells in mitosis with monopolar spindles; however, this effect was not observed in two-centrosome cells ( Fig. 4, A and B ).#####These results indicate that CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin play an important role in bipolar spindle formation specifically in one-centrosome cells, but not in two-centrosome cells.#####To further investigate this process, we tracked the dynamics of spindle poles in one-centrosome cells using time-lapse observation of NuMA tagged with mCherry.#####Upon depletion of CDK5RAP2 or pericentrin, the separation of two NuMA foci was normally detectable in early mitosis ( Fig. 4, C and D ;  Videos 8 ,  9 , and  10 ), while the time from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to cytokinesis was prolonged ( Fig. 4, C, E, and F ;  Videos 8 ,  9 , and  10 ).#####Next, by using proTAME (APC/C inhibitor) treatment, we arrested pericentrin or CDK5RAP2-depleted HeLa cells with one centrosome in metaphase to artificially induce bipolar spindle formation.#####Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that in these HeLa cells, the degree of CEP192 localization at the acentrosomal spindle poles was significantly reduced compared with that in control cells ( Fig. 4, G–I ).#####These results indicate that PCM scaffold proteins CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin are crucial for the recruitment of CEP192 at the acentrosomal spindle pole and bipolar spindle formation but are likely dispensable for the early step of spindle pole generation in one-centrosome cells.

2021	PMC7812875	To verify whether pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 are important for bipolar spindle formation in other human cell lines with one centrosome, we observed the spindle structure of RPE1 and A549 cells upon depletion of pericentrin or CDK5RAP2.#####Through immunostaining, we found that in cells with one centrosome, depletion of pericentrin or CDK5RAP2 induced the formation of monopolar spindles ( Fig. S3, A–D ).#####These results further support the conclusion that the PCM proteins are required for bipolar spindle formation in one-centrosome cells.

2021	PMC7812875	Next, we sought to further analyze the importance of PCM components at PCM poles for cell division in one-centrosome cells.#####Since siRNA-mediated depletion reduces the total expression level of CDK5RAP2 and pericentrin, it is difficult to analyze the function of the PCM components specifically at PCM poles ( Fig. 4 ).#####Therefore, we used another approach, depleting CEP57, to indirectly manipulate the amount of PCM components at PCM poles.#####CEP57 provides a critical interface between the centriole and PCM, and depletion of CEP57 induces the fragmentation of PCM proteins in early mitosis of human cells ( Watanabe et al., 2019 ).#####Given that 38.5% of one-centrosome cells assembled PCM poles by splitting PCM from the centrosome ( Fig. 3, A and D ;  Video 4 ), we hypothesized that upon CEP57 depletion, the PCM that is dissociated from the centrosome could be incorporated into the acentriolar pole in one-centrosome cells.#####As expected, the amount of pericentrin at PCM poles was significantly increased, presumably due to the increased PCM fragmentation at centriolar poles after CEP57 depletion ( Fig. 5, A–C ).#####Subsequently, to analyze the effect of CEP57 depletion on the mitotic processes of one-centrosome cells, we performed time-lapse imaging of NuMA and microtubules.#####We found that depletion of CEP57 promoted bipolar spindle formation more efficiently than in control cells and thereby shortened the mitotic duration ( Fig. 5, D–F ;  Videos 11  and  12 ).#####Under this condition, CEP57-depleted cells with one centrosome formed two separate NuMA foci, similar to siControl-treated one-centrosome cells, but established a bipolar spindle formation more efficiently ( Fig. 5, E and G ).#####Overall, these results suggest that accumulation of PCM components at PCM poles facilitates the bipolar spindle formation in one-centrosome cells.

2021	PMC7812875	The accumulation of PCM components at centrosomes in mitosis is regulated by PLK1 activity ( Haren et al., 2009 ;  Lee and Rhee, 2011 ;  Joukov et al., 2014 ).#####However, we found that PLK1 and phosphorylated PLK1 were not detected at most PCM poles in one-centrosome cells ( Fig. 6, A–D ).#####To determine if PLK1 was required for PCM pole assembly and subsequent bipolar spindle formation, we treated cells with a low dose of the PLK1 inhibitor BI 2536 (1 nM) and observed the amount of pericentrin at the centriolar pole and the spindle structure.#####Treatment of two-centrosome cells with a low dose of the PLK1 inhibitor caused chromosome congression errors and a slight reduction of pericentrin at centrosomes but did not affect bipolar spindle formation ( Fig. 6, E–G ).#####In contrast, in one-centrosome cells, PLK1 inhibition prevented PCM pole formation and led to the formation of monopolar spindles ( Fig. 6, E and F ).#####In addition, PLK1 inhibition greatly reduced the level of pericentrin at the centriolar pole compared with the level recorded in two-centrosome cells ( Fig. 6 G ).#####Together, these results suggest that PLK1 activity is crucial for PCM pole assembly and subsequent bipolar spindle formation in one-centrosome cells.

2021	PMC7812875	Although pericentrin and CDK5RAP2 are dispensable for efficient mitotic progression in cells with two centrosomes ( Fig. 1, A and B ;  Fig. 2 C ; and  Fig. S1 G ;  Videos 1 ,  3 ,  15 ,  17 , and  18 ), the detailed functions of these PCM components in bipolar spindle formation have not been carefully examined.#####We subsequently analyzed the spindle length upon depletion of pericentrin or CDK5RAP2 in HeLa cells.#####We found that depletion of pericentrin significantly reduced the spindle length compared with that of control cells, whereas depletion of CDK5RAP2 had a limited effect on the spindle length ( Fig. 7, A and B ).#####To further investigate this defect upon depletion of pericentrin, we performed live-cell imaging of mitotic spindle formation in HeLa and HCT116 cells.#####Depletion of pericentrin delayed the elongation of two spindle poles ( Fig. 7, E and F ;  Fig. S4, A and B ;  Videos 13 ,  14 ,  27 , and  28 ).#####These results suggest that pericentrin supports spindle elongation.#####In line with this result, IF analysis revealed that in pericentrin-depleted HeLa cells, the degree of CEP192 localization at the spindle poles was reduced; however, this was not observed in CDK5RAP2-depleted cells ( Fig. 7, C and D ).#####This observation implies that pericentrin more efficiently recruits CEP192 to centrosomes, thereby facilitating spindle elongation.

2021	PMC7938805	We used the E1 cell line, a clonal cell line derived from oviductal epithelium of a  p53  knockout mouse, to perform cell-biological analyses of multiciliogenesis ( Nakano et al., 2017 ;  Umezu et al., 2010 ).#####A previous study showed that E1 cells have the capacity to differentiate into ciliated cells in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures ( Nakano et al., 2017 ).#####We first confirmed that E1 cells differentiated into multiciliated cells in ALI culture, and could observe both centriole amplification and cilia formation ( Fig. 1 A,B;  Fig. S1A ).#####The cells in which centriole amplification was observed were forkhead box J1 (FoxJ1)-positive, suggesting that E1 cells differentiated into multiciliated cells through the canonical FoxJ1-mediated pathway ( Fig. 1 C).#####Of note, FoxJ1 is an essential transcription factor for multiciliogenesis ( Yu et al., 2008 ).#####In addition, cilia and centrioles were positioned at the apical side of cells, suggesting that apico–basal polarity was established in differentiated E1 cells ( Fig. 1 D).#####These findings were similar to those observed in oviductal epithelium ( Dirksen and Satir, 1972 ).#####Multiple Deup1 foci were associated with centrin foci in the differentiation of E1 cells, as observed in other primary culture cells ( Fig. S1D ,  E ) ( Zhao et al., 2013 ,  2019 ).#####From these results, we decided to use the E1 cell line as a model system for the study of multiciliogenesis.##### Fig. 1.#####Deup1 forms stable assemblies during multiciliogenesis.##### (A) Differentiation of E1 cells.#####E1 cells were fixed and immunostained before (ALI 0 days) and after (ALI 12 days) differentiation.#####Scale bar, 10 µm.#####Green and blue represent acetylated tubulin and DNA, respectively.#####(B) Representative image of differentiated E1 cells.#####E1 cells were cultured in ALI for 21 days and fixed for immunostaining.#####Scale bar, 10 µm.#####In merged images, green, magenta and blue represent acetylated tubulin, γ-tubulin and DNA, respectively.#####(C) Immunostaining of FoxJ1 in differentiated E1 cells cultured in ALI for 21 days.#####Scale bar, 10 µm.#####In merged images, green, magenta and blue represent FoxJ1, γ-tubulin and DNA, respectively.

2021	PMC7938805	It has been previously reported that Deup1 assembles into macromolecular structures even in undifferentiating cells ectopically expressing Deup1 ( Zhao et al., 2013 ).#####We confirmed that ectopically-expressed Deup1 formed macromolecular structures in undifferentiated E1 cells ( Fig. 2 A;  Fig. S1B ,  C ).#####We performed FRAP analysis of mScarlet I-Deup1 in undifferentiated E1 cells to further characterize the properties of Deup1 assemblies.#####We found that, even in the undifferentiated cells, mScarlet I-Deup1 showed a slow turnover within the Deup1 assemblies (recovery: 6±3% at 290 s after photobleaching) ( Fig. 2 B).#####This result indicates that Deup1 has the ability to form stable assemblies even in the cytoplasm of undifferentiated cells.#####Although there is a possibility that fluorescence protein tagging or an alternate isoform of Deup1 may influence the dynamics of Deup1, we confirmed that Deup1 formed static assemblies in the cytoplasm even with C-terminus tagging (Deup1-mScarlet I), GFP tagging, and a shorter isoform of Deup1 ( Fig. 2 C,D;  Fig. S3A ,  B ).#####Importantly, some Deup1 assemblies were not associated with centrin foci in undifferentiated cells ( Fig. 2 E).#####This result implies that the Deup1 assemblies are formed independently of the pre-existing centrioles, which is consistent with recent findings showing that the deuterosomes themselves form independently of the presence of pre-existing centrioles ( Mercey et al., 2019b ;  Nanjundappa et al., 2019 ;  Zhao et al., 2019 ).##### Fig. 2.#####Ectopically expressed Deup1 forms non-dynamic assemblies in undifferenciated cells.##### (A) Ectopic expression of mScarlet I-Deup1 in undifferentiated E1 cells.#####Scale bar, 10 µm.#####(B)-(D) FRAP analysis of (B) mScarlet I-Deup1, (C) Deup1-mScarlet I and (D) GFP-Deup1 short isoform in undifferentiated E1 cells.#####Scale bar, 5 µm; magnified image, 1 µm.#####Intensities were normalized with the average of three pre-bleach signals.#####Graphs show mean±s.d.#####of (B) 16 cells and (C)-(D) 8 cells from two independent experiments.#####(E) Undifferentiated E1 cells expressing Deup1-Myc.#####Cells were stained with anti-Myc and anti-Centrin antibodies.#####Scale bar, 10 µm; magnified image, 1 µm.

2021	PMC7938805	Deup1 assemblies can be formed by ectopic expression of Deup1 in undifferentiated cells.#####Thus, we hypothesized that Deup1 itself forms macromolecular assemblies through self-assembly.#####To address this, we analyzed the biochemical properties of the purified mScarlet I-Deup1 protein ( Fig. 3 A and  Fig. S4A ).#####We used polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a molecular crowding reagent to investigate the properties of Deup1 in an environment with molecular crowding that mimics the cytoplasmic state.#####We found that, in the presence of PEG, Deup1 assembled into macromolecular structures  in vitro , whereas mScarlet I alone did not form such structures ( Fig. 3 A,B).#####The frequency of formation of Deup1 assemblies depended on the concentrations of PEG and Deup1 ( Fig. 3 A and C).#####In addition, a high concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which also functions as a molecular crowding reagent, promoted Deup1 self-assembly ( Fig. 3 D) ( Nishizawa et al., 2017 ;  Wieczorek et al., 2013 ).#####These Deup1 assemblies were several hundreds of nanometers in diameter ( Fig. 3 E,F).#####These results suggest that Deup1 possesses the property to self-assemble into macro-molecular structures in molecular crowding conditions.##### Fig. 3.#####Deup1 self-assembles into condensates  in vitro .##### (A) Purified mScarlet I-Deup1 protein forms macro-molecular structures in the presence of PEG.#####Left, CBB staining of purified proteins.#####Arrowheads refer to the purified target proteins.#####Right, Representative images of 100 nM purified mScarlet I (mS) and mScarlet I-Deup1 (mS-Deup1).#####The indicated concentration of PEG was added into the buffer solution.##### n =40, 36, 40, 40, 32 and 40 fields.#####Scale bar, 2 µm.

2021	PMC7938805	We performed FRAP analysis of mScarlet I-Deup1 to investigate the biophysical properties of the Deup1 assemblies formed  in vitro .#####Consistent with the results observed in cells, we found that turnover of mScarlet I-Deup1 was barely observed within the Deup1 assemblies  in vitro  (recovery: 1±1% t 290 s after photobleaching) ( Fig. 4 A).#####In addition, internal rearrangement in Deup1 assemblies was undetectable following partial bleaching of the fluorescence of mScarlet I-Deup1 assemblies ( Fig. S4B ).#####We also found that, after longer-term incubations with Deup1 (90 min and 24 h), Deup1 foci were subsequently assembled into larger and more irregular structures ( Fig. 4 B,C).#####It has been shown that liquid-like biomolecular condensates are assembled into spherical droplet-like structures ( Boeynaems et al., 2018 ;  Woodruff et al., 2018 ).#####Therefore, our results suggest that Deup1 assemblies are not liquid-like droplets but, rather, are gel-like or solid structures.#####Similar irregular structures of Deup1 were observed in undifferentiated E1 cells expressing mScarlet I-Deup1, suggesting that the Deup1 assemblies formed  in vitro  share similar material properties with Deup1 condensates in cells ( Fig. 4 D).#####We confirmed that a shorter isoform of Deup1 also self-assembled into static structures  in vitro  ( Fig. S4C,D ).#####These results suggest that Deup1 possesses the ability to self-assemble into non-dynamic condensates both  in vitro  and in cells.##### Fig. 4.#####Deup1 forms non-dynamic condensates  in vitro .##### (A) FRAP analysis of mScarlet I-Deup1 formed in the presence of 6% PEG.#####Intensities were normalized with the average of three pre-bleach signals.#####Graph shows mean±s.d.#####of 9 condensates from two independent experiments.#####Scale bar, 2 µm.

2021	PMC7938805	We also tested whether the Deup1 assemblies formed  in vitro  functioned as a scaffold for the recruitment of a critical centriole component.#####For this purpose, we examined whether the  in vitro  self-assembled Deup1 has the capacity to recruit Cep152 (a known interactor) into the structure ( Zhao et al., 2013 ).#####As expected, Cep152-SNAP-Halo was selectively concentrated on the self-assembled Deup1 assemblies compared with SNAP-Halo alone ( Fig. S4E ).#####These results suggest that Deup1 self-assembly is sufficient for concentrating Cep152  in vitro  and in cells.
2021	PMC7938805	We constructed several fragments of Deup1 and ectopically expressed mScarlet I-Deup1 fragments in undifferentiated E1 cells to identify the domains of Deup1 that confer the ability to self-assemble ( Fig. S5A –  C ).#####Unexpectedly, most Deup1 fragments we designed assembled into macromolecular structures in the cytoplasm ( Fig. S5A –  C ).#####These results suggest that Deup1 assembles through multiple interactions between Deup1 molecules.#####Our comprehensive analysis revealed that the C-terminus fragment (467–601 a.a.) of Deup1, containing the reported Cep152 binding region, seldom assembled into macromolecular structures alone and, rather, showed a diffuse distribution in undifferentiated E1 cells ( Fig. 5 A,B).#####In contrast, the N-terminus fragment (1–466 a.a.) of Deup1, containing multiple coiled coil domains, showed self-assembly properties similar to those of full-length Deup1 ( Fig. 5 A,B).#####The purified N-terminus fragment of Deup1 also showed strong self-assembly properties  in vitro  (as observed with full-length Deup1), whereas the C-terminus fragments did not ( Fig. 5 C;  Figs S4C and S5E ).#####Moreover, ectopically expressed human Deup1 also assembled into macromolecular structures via its N-terminus in HeLa cells, suggesting that human Deup1 also possesses similar properties to those of mouse Deup1 ( Fig. S5F ,  G ).#####These results suggest that Deup1 self-assembles via its N-terminus region, presumably through multiple interactions between Deup1 molecules.##### Fig. 5.#####Deup1 self-assembles via its N-terminus.##### (A) Prediction of coiled coil and disordered regions in mouse Deup1 protein.#####Regions of Deup1 fragments are shown.#####N-terminus, 1-466 a.a..

2021	PMC7938805	It may be hypothesized that the self-assembly of Deup1 via its N-terminus is sufficient for the spatial compartmentalization of centriole proteins.#####To address this possibility, we replaced the N-terminus region of human Deup1 (1–468 a.a.) with an optogenetic oligomerization tag (CRY2clust), which self-assembles into condensates under blue light ( Park et al., 2017 ) ( Fig. 6 A).#####This system provided control over the assembly of the mScarlet I-tagged Deup1 C-terminus condensates in HeLa cells ( Fig. 6 B).#####As observed with the full-length Deup1, the CRY2clust fused-Deup1 C-terminus rapidly accumulated GFP-Cep152 at the condensates after photo-activation of CRY2clust; this effect was not observed with CRY2clust alone ( Fig. 6 C;  Fig. S6A,D , E ).#####We confirmed that the CRY2clust-Deup1 C-terminus did not concentrates GFP alone, indicating that the CRY2clust-Deup1 C-terminus specifically compartmentalizes GFP-Cep152 in the cytoplasm ( Fig. S6C ).#####Importantly, assemblies of the CRY2clust-Deup1 C-terminus accumulated GFP-Plk4, a master kinase for centriole biogenesis ( Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005 ;  Habedanck et al., 2005 ), at the condensates when this protein was expressed along with Cep152-SNAP ( Fig. 6 D;  Fig. S6F ,  G ).#####These results demonstrate that self-assembly of Deup1 via its N-terminus drives the spatial compartmentalization of Cep152 and Plk4 in the cytoplasm.#####These data also suggest that the Deup1 N-terminus promotes its self-assembly to generate scaffolds in the cytoplasm, whereas the C-terminus directly binds to Cep152 to selectively compartmentalize procentriole components ( Fig. 6 E).#####From these findings, we propose that Deup1 self-assembly generates a structural core for deuterosomes, which dictates centriole biogenesis in multiciliogenesis through the accumulation of procentriole components ( Fig. 6 E).##### Fig. 6.#####Deup1 self-assembly via its N-terminus induces accumulation of Cep152 and Plk4 in the cytoplasm.##### (A) Schematic of the experimental design.#####Human Deup1 N-terminus region (1-468 a.a.) was replaced with CRY2clust (CRY2c).#####(B) Representative image of blue light induced condensation of mScarlet I-CRY2clust-Deup1-C (469-604 a.a.) was shown.#####Scale bar, 10 µm.

2019	PMC6777370	To track the behavior of endogenous proteins in live cells, we observed HCT116 cell lines by spinning disc confocal microscopy, as previously described ( Takao et al., 2019 ).#####Since centriole duplication is sensitive to the expression level of the core components (e.g. overexpression of a component is known to induce overduplication of centrioles), we used endogenous tagging of target proteins.#####However, given the limited number of copies of endogenous centriole duplication components ( Bauer et al., 2016 ), the signal from an endogenous fluorescent tag could be too weak to detect in live imaging.#####To address this issue, as previously demonstrated in both  Drosophila  embryos ( Aydogan et al., 2018 ,  2019  preprint) and cultured human cells ( Takao et al., 2019 ), we successfully used spinning disc confocal microscopy with an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera to track the dynamics of endogenous proteins at centrioles.#####This avoided significant photobleaching of the fluorescent tag and phototoxicity to the cells throughout the entire cell cycle.#####In addition to Plk4 ( Takao et al., 2019 ), we also endogenously tagged STIL and HsSAS6 with fluorescent proteins at their C-termini using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with optimized C-terminal tagging vectors ( Fig. 1 A;  Fig. S6 ) ( Natsume et al., 2016 ).#####In the live-cell imaging, Z-stacks of fluorescence images were acquired every 10 min for up to 30 h. The cells that normally lasted at least one entire cell cycle (typically around 16 h for HCT116 cells) in the total image acquisition period were used for all data analyses, to ensure that we used only cells that had entered their next cell cycle without phototoxicity.##### Fig. 1.#####Live imaging of endogenously tagged proteins involved in centriole duplication.##### (A) Time course of centriolar Plk4-mClover fluorescence from a single cell.#####The cell divided twice during the 30 h observation period, as indicated by the arrows showing metaphase.#####Schematics in the graph show putative spatial patterns of Plk4 around the mother centriole at the corresponding time points.#####The endogenous tagging system is schematically shown on the right.#####(B–D)#####Averaged time courses of Plk4-mClover (B), STIL-mCherry (C) and HsSAS6-mCherry (D) signals at the centrioles of 14, 11 and 12 cells, respectively.#####Time course data were aligned at metaphase (0 h).#####The period between two metaphase time points is defined as one cycle.#####Note that the length of the cycle varies slightly among the averaged graphs due to the variety in the cell population.#####Representative images are shown on the left of each graph.#####Error bars, s.d.

2019	PMC6777370	First, we confirmed that the fluorescence intensity of Plk4-mClover oscillated in concert with the cell cycle in human cells ( Fig. 1 A,B).#####This oscillation has been shown to reflect the changes in the spatial pattern of centriolar Plk4, i.e. from the ring-like to the single-focus pattern ( Takao et al., 2019 ), as schematically shown in the graph in  Fig. 1 A. We typically tracked fluorescence signals for a period covering two oscillations in order to confirm that cells enter the next cell cycle without phototoxic effects.#####Although fluorescence signals gradually decreased over time courses, presumably due to photobleaching ( Fig. 1 A), the decrease was subtle and at least one complete oscillation cycle was successfully tracked in each observation.#####To further verify the behavior of Plk4-mClover at centrioles, we monitored the effect of treatment with a Plk4 inhibitor, centrinone ( Wong et al., 2015 ).#####Centrinone treatment is known to promote centriolar accumulation of Plk4 in a few hours, presumably by inhibiting dissociation and/or degradation of Plk4 ( Ohta et al., 2018 ).#####Indeed, the centriolar Plk4-mClover signal increased five- to tenfold immediately following the addition of centrinone, regardless of the stage of interphase ( Fig. S1 ), suggesting that centriolar accumulation of Plk4 is tightly regulated by its phosphorylation state during interphase.#####Interestingly, during mitosis, the Plk4-mClover signal decreased, even in the presence of centrinone ( Fig. S1 ).
2019	PMC6777370	We then similarly observed the dynamics of STIL-mCherry and HsSAS6-mCherry at centrioles throughout the cell cycle ( Fig. 1 C,D).#####In contrast to Plk4-mClover, which started increasing immediately after mitotic exit ( Fig. 1 B), the fluorescence intensity of STIL-mCherry and HsSAS6-mCherry started increasing about 2–5 h after mitotic exit, and decreased just before the next mitosis ( Fig. 1 C,D).#####This is consistent with previous observations, in which endogenous or exogenously-expressed STIL and HsSAS6 were absent from centrioles during the early G1 phase ( Strnad et al., 2007 ;  Arquint et al., 2012 ;  Arquint and Nigg, 2014 ).#####To further investigate whether STIL and HsSAS6 are indeed absent from centrioles during the post-mitotic time window, we attempted to detect signals with higher sensitivity by switching tags from mCherry to mClover, one of the brightest fluorescent proteins.#####Both time courses were quite similar ( Fig. S2A,B ), but on closer inspection a weak centriolar signal of HsSAS6-mClover was detectable during and immediately after mitosis ( Fig. S2C ).#####It is surprising that HsSAS6 is already present around centrioles during the early G1 phase, albeit at very low levels.#####This discrepancy from previous observations may stem from differences in the immunofluorescence protocols.#####One possibility is that the centriolar fraction of HsSAS6 during the early G1 phase is not in a rigid structure like cartwheels, so these molecules would not be retained at centrioles during the fixation procedure.#####This observation aside, the majority of the centriolar HsSAS6 we observed started accumulating at the centrioles later in the cell cycle, regardless of the tags we used ( Fig. 1 D;  Fig. S2B ), as previously observed via immunofluorescence ( Keller et al., 2014 ;  Strnad et al., 2007 ).#####This centriolar HsSAS6 thus probably corresponds to the stack of cartwheels, at least in part.#####The meaning of the fraction of centriolar HsSAS6 that is present during the early G1 phase is yet to be addressed.#####It is possible that it provides the seed for the onset of cartwheel assembly.#####Alternatively, it could merely be a meaningless fraction that happens to be trapped in the crowded pericentriolar environment ( Fu and Glover, 2012 ;  Lawo et al., 2012 ;  Mennella et al., 2012 ;  Sonnen et al., 2012 ;  Woodruff et al., 2017 ).#####Regardless, this approach of optimized live-cell imaging with endogenous tagging illustrates the distinct dynamics of critical centriole duplication factors throughout the cell cycle in human cells.
2019	PMC6777370	We then sought to investigate how the centriolar dynamics of the core duplication components correlate with each other.#####To this end, we generated cell lines in which both Plk4 and STIL or HsSAS6 were endogenously tagged with mClover and mCherry, respectively.#####Data from simultaneous live imaging of the two proteins are shown in  Fig. 2 A,B and  Figs S3  and  S4 .#####To precisely compare the time courses of the two proteins, data were not pooled as in  Fig. 1 B–D; rather, data from single cells are shown individually (smoothed by applying a moving average through time for noise reduction).#####In contrast to the averaged curves, both STIL- and HsSAS6-mCherry tended to exhibit a steep and sometimes stepwise increase in fluorescence upon centriolar accumulation ( Fig. 2 A,B;  Figs S3  and  S4 ).##### Fig. 2.#####Distinct behavior of STIL and HsSAS6 relative to Plk4 in centriolar accumulation.##### (A,B) Simultaneous imaging of endogenously tagged Plk4 and STIL (A) or HsSAS6 (B).#####Representative images (left) and two example graphs (right) are shown for each.#####Scale bars: 5 μm.#####Each graph shows data from a single cell with moving-average smoothing (±3 time points).#####The time course of normalized fluorescence is shown in two different ways: fluorescence of each component against time (top) and against each other and time color-coded (bottom).#####Arrows on the graphs indicate the direction of the time course.#####See also  Figs S3  and  S4 .#####(C,D) Cross-correlation analysis to compare the time courses of STIL-mCherry or HsSAS6-mCherry with that of Plk4-mClover.#####Schematics of how to obtain the time lag (Δt) based on cross-correlation (C) and obtained Δt values (D) are shown.#####A.U., arbitrary units.

2019	PMC6777370	The centriolar STIL-mCherry signal tended to start increasing at the peak in the time course of the centriolar Plk4-mClover signal.#####In other words, the centriolar Plk4-mClover signal started increasing after mitotic exit, and decreased just after the centriolar STIL-mCherry signal started increasing ( Fig. 2 A;  Fig. S3 ).#####Thus, centriolar accumulation of STIL probably triggers the decrease in centriolar Plk4.#####This is consistent with previous immunofluorescence observations, as well as the model in which centriolar loading of STIL promotes disassembly of the ring-like pattern of Plk4 to form the single-focus pattern ( Arquint et al., 2015 ;  Ohta et al., 2018 ,  2014 ).#####The centriolar HsSAS6-mCherry signal, on the other hand, only began to increase dramatically after the Plk4-mClover signal had started decreasing ( Fig. 2 B;  Fig. S4 ).
2019	PMC6777370	To further verify the sequential accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6, we next used cross-correlation analysis to compare the time lags in the centriolar accumulation of STIL-mCherry and HsSAS6-mCherry relative to Plk4-mClover ( Fig. 2 C,D).#####Because it is difficult to quantitatively define parameters such as the ‘peak’ and ‘onset’ of signal time courses from the actual graphs ( Fig. 2 A,B), in this analysis, the lag of gross waveforms between each time course graph (cross-correlation) was calculated.#####For Plk4-mClover and STIL-mCherry, this time lag was on average 4.1 h, and for Plk4-mClover and HsSAS6-mCherry, it was on average 5.6 h ( Fig. 2 D).#####It is therefore likely that after a certain amount of STIL has accumulated at a Plk4 focus around centrioles, HsSAS6 begins stacking cartwheels on the focus.#####The centriolar STIL level, similarly to that of HsSAS6, kept increasing after the drop in centriolar Plk4, suggesting that STIL and HsSAS6 are coordinately incorporated into the stack of cartwheels.
2019	PMC6777370	Combined, these results suggest the following: (1) elevated loading of STIL triggers the pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 from the ring-like to the single-focus pattern; (2) following the gradual accumulation of phosphorylated STIL, and once the local concentration of HsSAS6 at the centrioles exceeds the threshold for cartwheel formation, the STIL–HsSAS6 complex is coordinately integrated into a stack of cartwheels; and (3) this transition leads to a stable and continuous reduction in Plk4 at the centrioles, which may contribute significantly to the formation of a single procentriole site.#####STIL may thus play multiple roles as a hub in these sequential processes during centriole duplication.
2019	PMC6777370	Since STIL and HsSAS6 are thought to induce the spatial-pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 ( Arquint et al., 2015 ;  Ohta et al., 2018 ,  2014 ), we then observed the behavior of centriolar Plk4 in cells depleted of STIL or HsSAS6 (as well as in a control culture).#####In live-cell imaging of endogenous Plk4-mClover after mitotic exit, the onset of centriolar accumulation and the time until it reached its peak fluorescence intensity were similar in all three conditions, although the accumulation rates seemed slightly faster in siSTIL- or siHsSAS6-treated cells than in the control ( Fig. 3 A).#####In stark contrast, upon depletion of STIL or HsSAS6, centriolar Plk4-mClover remained constant after reaching its fluorescence peak throughout the rest of the period until the next mitosis ( Fig. 3 A).#####The peak intensity of centriolar Plk4-mClover fluorescence in these conditions was comparable to that in the control ( Fig. 3 A).#####These results suggest that, in STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted cells, Plk4 forms the centriolar ring after mitotic exit as normal, but the pattern shift to a single focus never takes place.#####Indeed, when observed by immunofluorescence microscopy at a higher resolution, in line with previous observations ( Ohta et al., 2014 ), centriolar Plk4 primarily exhibited its ring-like pattern in STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted cells ( Fig. 3 B).##### Fig. 3.#####Effect of depletion of STIL or HsSAS6 on the behavior of centriolar Plk4.##### (A) Time course of centriolar Plk4-mClover fluorescence in cells transfected with siControl (top), siSTIL (mid) or siHsSAS6 (bottom).#####The results in the graphs are shown as mean±s.d.#####of 8, 10 and 8 cells, respectively.#####(B,C) Effect of depletion of STIL or HsSAS6 on the spatial patterning of centriolar Plk4.#####Representative high-resolution immunofluorescence images of Plk4 with and without the centriole marker CEP152 (B) and the ring-filling indices (C) for the three conditions.#####Scale bar: 0.5 μm.

2019	PMC6777370	To quantify the spatial pattern of Plk4, we calculated ring-filling indices for centriolar Plk4 from the immunofluorescence images.#####The ring-filling index is a parameter defined such that the more like a ring the spatial pattern of centriolar Plk4 is, the closer to 1 the index is ( Takao et al., 2019 ).#####Ring-filling indices of centriolar Plk4 in STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted cells were significantly higher than those in control cells ( Fig. 3 C).#####Taken together, these data show that both STIL and HsSAS6 are required for the pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 to a single focus but are dispensable for the initial formation of the ring-like pattern of Plk4.
2019	PMC6777370	Centriolar accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6 is known to be interdependent ( Tang et al., 2011 ;  Arquint et al., 2012 ;  Vulprecht et al., 2012 ).#####We confirmed by using immunofluorescence microscopy that STIL is mostly absent from centrioles in cells that are depleted of HsSAS6 and vice versa ( Fig. 3 D).#####Therefore, STIL and HsSAS6 may cooperatively stabilize the centriolar Plk4 focus, with slightly different time courses, to provide a single site for procentriole formation.#####Interestingly, the ring-filling indices for Plk4 differed slightly between siSTIL- and siHsSAS6-treated cells ( Fig. 3 C).#####This may reflect differences in the roles of STIL and HsSAS6 in the spatial regulation of Plk4 at centrioles, although further investigation is required.
2019	PMC6777370	To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying procentriole formation with respect to the dynamic behavior of the participating components, we constructed a mathematical model to reproduce the experimental results by simulation ( Fig. 4 A).#####Plk4 possesses intrinsic self-organization properties, such as self-assembly and the promotion of dissociation/degradation (hereafter collectively referred to as dissociation) of Plk4 molecules in an autophosphorylation-dependent manner ( Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ).#####Based on these properties, as in the previous model simulating the spatial patterning of centriolar Plk4 ( Takao et al., 2019 ), the present model assumes that the autophosphorylation-mediated activation of Plk4 promotes its dissociation from the centriole.#####STIL promotes the kinase activity of Plk4 and thus the dissociation of centriolar Plk4.#####STIL also attenuates the dissociation of phosphorylated Plk4 via direct binding.#####This complex regulation is thought to be mediated by the bimodal binding of STIL to Plk4 ( Ohta et al., 2018 ).#####Indeed, centriolar loading of STIL is mediated by Plk4 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.#####Given that HsSAS6 can be detected at centrioles during the early G1 phase ( Fig. S2C ), centrioles can recruit HsSAS6 just after mitotic exit, but may not be able to retain much of it at that stage.#####Since the steep increase in centriolar STIL preceded that of HsSAS6 and continued in concert with it ( Fig. 2 ;  Figs S3  and  S4 ), the model assumes that phosphorylated STIL mediates the cartwheel assembly via direct interaction with HsSAS6.#####In addition, it may be reasonable to assume that HsSAS6 is retained at centrioles once it has formed a closed ring and been incorporated into the stable cartwheel structure, resulting in a drastic increase in the centriolar HsSAS6 level.#####The formation of cartwheel structures may also require phosphorylated STIL as part of the stable structure, thus preventing it from dissociating.#####Via the interaction network described above, in our model Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6 cooperatively generate a single site for procentriole formation.##### Fig. 4.#####Mathematical modeling of the centriolar dynamics of Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6.##### (A) Schematic of the mathematical model.#####The definitions of rate constant k are as follows: k p1  and k p2  are the entry and dissociation rates of centiolar Plk4.#####k p3  and k p4  are the self- and trans-autophosphorylation rates of Plk4.#####k p5  is the dissociation rate of centriolar phospho-Plk4.#####k st1  and k st2  are the entry and dissociation rates of centriolar STIL.#####k cw  is the rate of cartwheel assembly of HsSAS6.#####k sas1  and k sas2  are the entry and dissociation rates of centriolar HsSAS6.#####Plk4-p, STIL-p and HsSAS6-cw denote the phosphorylated forms of Plk4 and STIL, and HsSAS6 in the cartwheel structure, respectively.#####See the text and Materials and Methods for details.#####(B) Simulated time course of Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6 at a centriole.#####Total quantities (Plk4+Plk4-p, STIL+STIL-p, and HsSAS6+HsSAS6-cw) are shown.#####Note that quantity and time are all relative (dimensionless).#####(C) Changes in the quantity of Plk4 against that of STIL or HsSAS6.#####The simulation data have been plotted in the same way as in the graphs in  Fig. 2 .

2019	PMC6777370	Using the model, we simulated the time course of the molecules throughout the cell cycle.#####For simplicity, we have displayed the total quantity of each component at the centriole in  Fig. 4 B, although the actual simulation included subclasses of components (e.g. the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Plk4;  Fig. S5 ).#####Our live-cell imaging did not distinguish between such subclasses, so it is the data shown in  Fig. 4 B that should be compared with the live-cell imaging data.#####The simulated time courses were quite similar to those in our actual observations, and the parametric plots (Plk4 versus STIL or HsSAS6) from the simulation ( Fig. 4 C) also resembled the experimental data ( Fig. 2 A,B;  Figs S3  and  S4 ).#####The model could therefore convincingly reproduce the experimental data obtained under normal physiological conditions.
2019	PMC6777370	We then compared the simulation data with the experimental data obtained under STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted conditions.#####In both cases, the increased level of Plk4 was maintained over time after it had reached its peak and the onset of Plk4 accumulation was unaffected ( Fig. 4 D).#####Centriolar accumulation of HsSAS6 was significantly attenuated with the depletion of STIL and vice versa ( Fig. 4 D).#####Thus, the simulations based on our model also convincingly reproduced the experimental data obtained under perturbed conditions.
2019	PMC6777370	As has been previously proposed ( Arquint et al., 2015 ;  Ohta et al., 2018 ,  2014 ), the spatial-pattern shift of Plk4 from the pericentriolar ring to a single focus is mediated by STIL and HsSAS6.#####However, how exactly the coordinated action of the three components creates a single site for procentriole assembly remains elusive.#####Based on both experimental observations and simulations, we propose a model of procentriole formation as schematically illustrated in  Fig. 4 E. Our live-cell imaging of single cells throughout the cell cycle demonstrated that the centriolar loading of both STIL and HsSAS6 is tightly associated with, and indeed required for, the rapid decrease in Plk4 after it has reached its fluorescence peak.#####Our mathematical modeling and simulation faithfully reproduce these processes.#####The significance of STIL in the spatial patterning of centriolar Plk4 has also been demonstrated using another mathematical model, which assumes different behavior and interactions of Plk4, STIL and their phosphatases ( Leda et al., 2018 ).
2019	PMC6777370	Interestingly, immediately after mitotic exit, HsSAS6 can already be recruited to centrioles, presumably in the free dimer state, despite its low levels (Fig. 4E; Fig. S2C).#####It exhibits a high dissociation constant for the self-assembly of N-terminal head domains to form a ninefold symmetric ring ( van Breugel et al., 2011 ;  Kitagawa et al., 2011 ), however, these low levels may not be sufficient to initiate cartwheel assembly.#####Phosphorylated STIL promotes centriolar accumulation of HsSAS6 by forming a complex that is thought to be a crucial process in cartwheel assembly ( Moyer et al., 2015 ;  Kratz et al., 2015 ;  Ohta et al., 2014 ).#####We thus hypothesize that once the local concentration of HsSAS6 dimers exceeds the threshold for forming a closed, rigid ring as the center of the cartwheel structure, increasing numbers of HsSAS6 dimers flow into the stream of the building stack of cartwheels.#####This is analogous to a previous model based on an  in vitro  reconstitution assay using  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  SAS6 and mathematical modeling, which suggested that the cartwheel assembly mechanism was mediated by the  Chlamydomonas  protein Bld10p ( Klein et al., 2016 ;  Goldie et al., 2017 ;  Nievergelt et al., 2018 ).#####Given that STIL is thought to be a part of the cartwheel structure ( Stevens et al., 2010 ), this system acts as a positive feedback loop for the accumulation of the STIL–HsSAS6 complex at centrioles.#####Concurrently, at the procentriole assembly site, this increased quantity of the protein complex may suppress the dissociation of active Plk4 from centrioles via direct interaction, while promoting the activation and subsequent dissociation of neighboring Plk4 molecules from centrioles.#####In this way, it is possible that the structural integrity of assembling cartwheels is directly linked with the negative feedback loop that completely suppresses the formation of extra procentrioles.#####Indeed, it has been demonstrated that artificially induced degradation of centriolar HsSAS6 after cartwheel formation can cause re-assembly of Plk4 rings ( Yoshiba et al., 2019 ).#####Our data and these arguments suggest that positive and negative regulation within the Plk4–STIL–HsSAS6 network ensures accurate site selection for the formation of a single procentriole.
2019	PMC6777370	Recent work on  Drosophila  embryos has precisely described the dynamics of centriolar proteins including Plk4 and Sas6 ( Aydogan et al., 2018 ,  2019  preprint).#####The time course of  Drosophila  Plk4 is similar to that indicated by this study, although the cell cycle is much shorter (∼10–20 min) and the onset of centriolar Sas6 accumulation occurs before Plk4 reaches its peak ( Aydogan et al., 2018 ,  2019  preprint).#####However, given that Plk4 appears as a ring only in late mitosis, when Sas6 begins to be recruited to centrioles, similar regulation to that indicated in our study may be occurring at the onset of centriole duplication.#####In line with this, there seems to be a small Plk4 peak around mitotic exit in  Drosophila  embryos ( Aydogan et al., 2018 ,  2019  preprint).#####Despite the homology, the precise mechanisms regulating the rate and timing of each process may differ depending on the cell, tissue type and species.#####Further research, including optical imaging and molecular analyses of the protein dynamics, structural analyses and computational analyses, will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of centriole duplication.
2019	PMC6829667	During centriole duplication, Plk4 forms a ring-like pattern around the mother centriole and, subsequently, this pattern changes into a single focus, which provides the single duplication site ( Ohta et al., 2014 ,  2018 ;  Arquint et al., 2015 ).#####To quantitatively confirm this observation during the actual process of the cell cycle, we monitored centriolar Plk4 dynamics in live cells and correlated them with spatial patterns in fixed cells at a higher resolution.#####HCT116 cells, in which endogenous Plk4 was tagged with mClover, were synchronized via thymidine arrest, then observed via spinning disc confocal microscopy after thymidine release ( Fig. 1 A  and Fig. S1 A).#####Within 1 h after mitotic exit, during the putative early G1 phase, accumulation of Plk4 around the centrioles became apparent ( Fig. 1 A  and Fig. S1, A and B).#####Centriolar Plk4–mClover signals continued to increase for 3–5 h after mitotic exit, and then began to decrease as the cells progressed toward the next mitosis ( Fig. 1 A ).

Schematics in C show how ring-filling indices are calculated.#####AU, arbitrary units; deg, degrees.
2019	PMC6829667	Given the timing of the appearance of the Plk4 ring pattern (early G1 phase, before the formation of the daughter centriole) and the single-focus pattern (following the entry of STIL and HsSAS6), the increase and subsequent decrease in the Plk4–mClover signal may reflect the formation and disappearance of the ring pattern, respectively.#####Indeed, when observed at higher resolution via immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, the Plk4 ring pattern most frequently appeared 13 h after thymidine release.#####This corresponds to the time when the peaks in the Plk4–mClover signal were most frequently detected in the live cells ( Fig. 1, A and B ).#####At the onset of the increase in the Plk4–mClover signal in the live cells (10 h), only a small proportion of the fixed cells showed the ring pattern at the higher resolution.#####When the Plk4–mClover signal decreased as the cells progressed toward mitosis (5 or 18 h), the single-focus pattern became more dominant.
2019	PMC6829667	Interestingly, through careful observation, we found that the Plk4 rings in the putative early G1 phase were frequently incomplete.#####Some resembled Landolt rings ( Fig. 1 B , 10 h and 13 h, right panels), while others resembled partial arcs ( Fig. 1 B , 10 h, left panel).#####Even in the single-focus pattern, the Plk4 sometimes localized weakly in rings ( Fig. 1 B , 18 h).#####Therefore, instead of merely classifying the patterns into ring or single-focus, we defined a parameter that describes the degree of ring formation and termed it the “ring-filling index” ( Fig. 1 C ).#####Consequently, we confirmed that these indices reached their peak 13 h after thymidine release and subsequently decreased ( Fig. 1 D ).#####Combined, these findings demonstrate in a quantitative manner that Plk4 changes its spatial patterns around centrioles dynamically, in synchronization with the cell cycle.
2019	PMC6829667	We used STED super-resolution microscopy to further investigate the incomplete ring patterns of Plk4 at higher resolution.#####In STED observations, to our surprise, we detected discontinuity in the ring patterns ( Fig. 2 A ).#####Instead of the expected continuous ring, we observed a chain of foci forming a discrete ring (resembling a pearl necklace;  Fig. 2 A ).#####It is unlikely that these discrete patterns merely reflect transition states between a continuous ring and a single focus, as none of our STED images acquired in this experiment captured continuous rings.

2019	PMC6829667	We then extracted oval fluorescence intensity profiles to quantitatively analyze the Plk4 ring patterns ( Fig. 2, B and C ).#####In line with previous reports ( Ohta et al., 2014 ,  2018 ), in most cases we found uneven distribution patterns with single prominent peaks.#####In addition, as illustrated in  Fig. 2 B , the profiles exhibited spatial periodicity.#####We detected the peaks of the profiles and measured the angle (the distance in the profile plots) from each peak to its nearest neighbor to quantify the periodicity of the discrete ring patterns.#####Similar methods have been used successfully to analyze protein localization patterns in the ciliary transition zone or centriole distal appendages ( Shi et al., 2017 ;  Jana et al., 2018 ;  Yang et al., 2018 ).#####The average angle between nearest-neighbor pairs was ∼60° ( Fig. 2 D ).#####In other words, the discrete ring patterns tended to show a sixfold rotational symmetry.#####Autocorrelation analysis similarly demonstrated that the period of the discrete pattern was 65.0 ± 16.4° (Fig. S1 C).#####This was surprising, given the ninefold rotational symmetry of the centriole core architecture and the triplet microtubules.#####Therefore, an interpretation other than that based on the ninefold symmetry of the centriole architecture is required to explain the periodicity of the discrete ring patterns of Plk4.
2019	PMC6829667	We applied the super-resolution analysis to CEP152, the main scaffold of centriolar Plk4, to identify the factor generating the sixfold symmetry of the discrete ring patterns of Plk4.#####Via STED observations using an antibody to the N-terminal region of CEP152, we found that CEP152 also showed periodic patterns ( Fig. 2 E ).#####Unlike Plk4, we did not find obvious bias in the periodic patterns of CEP152, which was consistent with previous observations ( Ohta et al., 2018 ).#####Interestingly, the patterns of CEP152 showed higher spatial frequencies than those of Plk4.#####The average angle between nearest-neighbor peaks was ∼30° ( Fig. 2 E ).#####CEP152 therefore exhibits a rotational symmetry of order 12, which is double that of Plk4.#####Since the periodicity of the CEP152 localization patterns was not entirely clear, we conducted a further analysis for verification (Fig. S1, D and E).#####Combined, these results suggest that the scaffold CEP152 provides 12 slots for Plk4, but Plk4 appears to preferentially select six of them.
2019	PMC6829667	Besides the CEP152 scaffold, CEP192 serves as a scaffold of Plk4 at centrioles, and it is suggested that Plk4 switches its scaffold protein from CEP192 to CEP152 during centriole duplication processes ( Kim et al., 2013 ;  Park et al., 2014 ).#####We therefore similarly quantified the spatial pattern of centriolar CEP192 by STED analysis.#####Interestingly, centriolar CEP192 showed periodic patterns at intervals close to 40° ( Fig. 2 F ).#####As the diameter of centriolar CEP192 is much smaller than those of CEP152 and Plk4 ( Fig. 2, B, E, and F ), it is unclear whether the spatial pattern of centriolar CEP192 affects that of Plk4 through a direct interaction.
2019	PMC6829667	We then investigated how the discrete ring patterns of Plk4, with six uneven foci, are generated from the 12 slots of CEP152.#####To address this, we reasoned that the molecular nature of Plk4, which has recently been revealed ( Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ), may provide a clue.#####First, Plk4 self-assembles into a macromolecular complex (or protein aggregate).#####Second, its properties can switch, depending on its autophosphorylation state.#####Of note, the phosphorylated (“active”) form of Plk4 is more dynamic in dissociating from centrioles than the nonphosphorylated (“inactive”) form.#####In addition, the active form of Plk4 promotes the dissociation of inactive Plk4 through self-activation (trans-autophosphorylation) feedback.#####These properties of Plk4 suggest that it may form the discrete ring patterns by excluding neighboring Plk4 molecules in an autophosphorylation-dependent manner, whereas existing Plk4 complexes gain their mass through self-assembly.#####This mutual relationship between the active and inactive forms of Plk4 is similar to that of the reaction–diffusion (RD) system (also known as the Turing model) or its analogue, the LI system, which forms periodic patterns at the cellular or tissue level ( Nakamura et al., 2006 ;  Kondo and Miura, 2010 ;  Barad et al., 2011 ;  Liao and Oates, 2017 ).#####Accordingly, here we propose the first verifiable theory explaining the mechanism by which the self-organization properties of Plk4 form dynamic spatial patterns and exclusively provide the single duplication site during centriole duplication.#####The core concept of this theory, which is based on a recently proposed speculative model ( Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ), is shown in  Fig. 3 A .

2019	PMC6829667	Our theory assumes that the active form of Plk4 is dynamic and mobile within the periphery of centrioles.#####These properties render the active Plk4 capable of reaching and interacting with distant Plk4 molecules along the centriole periphery.#####This can cause a LI effect, in which active Plk4 molecules repel nearby inactive Plk4 molecules by promoting activation and subsequent dissociation.#####Assuming this LI effect, we constructed a mathematical model to simulate the pattern formation of Plk4 ( Fig. 3 B ; see Materials and methods for details).#####Simulations starting with random patterns resulted in the formation of approximately six uneven foci of Plk4 that tended to occupy alternate slots to form the distinct “pearl necklace” pattern ( Fig. 3 C ).#####Notably, most of the discrete ring patterns generated in the simulations had single prominent foci, similarly to those in the STED images.#####In the model, the balanced influx and efflux result in the limited pool of centriolar Plk4.#####In addition, the model assumed that the dissociation of centriolar Plk4 is attenuated once a certain quantity of Plk4 aggregate is formed in a given segment.#####This assumption is based on the concept that molecules on the surface are energetically more diffusible than the ones present inside a mass.#####The attenuation function was defined as a sigmoid that limits the dissociation rate of Plk4, depending on its quantity.#####The strength of this attenuation effect significantly contributed to the generation of the bias, while the sharpness of the effect did not (Fig. S2 A).#####Assuming these properties of Plk4, once one of the Plk4 foci becomes prominent at random, the focus accumulates more and more Plk4 molecules and wins the race of LI.
2019	PMC6829667	The pattern may be more dynamic, depending on the parameters used.#####For example, when the  k 6 value was twice that used in examples 1 and 2 ( Fig. 3 C ), the spatiotemporal patterning of Plk4 became more dynamic and resulted in a multiple oscillation mode (example 3).#####Nevertheless, it still exhibited discrete patterns with a prominent peak at each time point.#####This variation in the spatial and temporal patterns simulated may explain the variety of the spatial patterns of Plk4 observed in our STED analysis.#####The LI model proposed in this study thus reproduces the observed Plk4 patterns at centrioles well.
2019	PMC6829667	Given the somewhat unclear periodicity of the CEP152 spatial patterns, we tested the robustness of the model with respect to the periodicity of the scaffolds.#####All simulations using different numbers of slots (9, 10, 11, or 13) resulted in the formation of pearl necklace patterns (Fig. S2 B), as in the simulations using 12 slots ( Fig. 3, B and C ).#####The LI effect of Plk4 is thus not strictly dependent on the number of slots, and this model allows flexibility in scaffold conformation.#####Furthermore, when we more explicitly considered the lateral diffusion of Plk4 within the periphery of the centriole (Fig. S2 C; see Materials and methods for details), simulations also resulted in the formation of discrete ring patterns, regardless of the number of segments (Fig. S2 D).#####Together, these results further support our theory that Plk4 can self-organize into the patterns around centrioles by its intrinsic properties ( Fig. 3 A ).#####Hereafter, we adopt and further verify the LI model ( Fig. 3 B ) as a tentative model.
2019	PMC6829667	Using the LI model, we then simulated the pattern transition of Plk4 after the centriolar entry of STIL and HsSAS6 at the onset of procentriole formation ( Ohta et al., 2014 ,  2018 ).#####Since the mechanism through which STIL and HsSAS6 cooperatively regulate the pattern transition to restrict the duplication site remains unclear, in the model, we only included the centriolar entry of STIL, using it to represent the STIL–HsSAS6 complex.#####The time-evolved simulations were set as follows: (1) initially, the random seeds of Plk4 evolved to form discrete ring patterns via the LI effect, as shown in  Fig. 3 C ; (2) next, the expression level of STIL began to increase, as observed in the late G1 to S phases in human cells ( Izraeli et al., 1997 ;  Tang et al., 2011 ;  Arquint et al., 2012 ;  Arquint and Nigg, 2014 ); (3) finally, STIL entered the Plk4 slots in which the quantity of active (phosphorylated) Plk4 was above a given threshold as the centriolar loading of STIL has been reported to depend on Plk4-mediated phosphorylation ( Dzhindzhev et al., 2014 ,  2017 ;  Ohta et al., 2014 ;  Moyer et al., 2015 ;  McLamarrah et al., 2018 ).#####The other condition we considered in the simulations was that, once the cytosolic level of STIL had begun to increase, the cytosolic level of Plk4 was assumed to decrease, as increased quantities of STIL in the cytoplasm have been suggested to promote the degradation of Plk4 ( Arquint et al., 2015 ;  Moyer et al., 2015 ;  Ohta et al., 2018 ).
2019	PMC6829667	Consequently, simulations using the LI model reproduced the Plk4 pattern transition from the discrete ring into the single focus upon centriolar loading of the STIL–HsSAS6 complex ( Fig. 4 A ).#####The most prominent focus of Plk4 in the rings tended to remain after STIL–HsSAS6 loading.#####In addition, simulations including negative-feedback regulation mediated by the Plk4–STIL interaction ( Ohta et al., 2018 ) yielded similar results but with slightly faster transition from the discrete ring into the single focus after centriolar loading of the STIL–HsSAS6 complex (Fig. S2 E).
2019	PMC6829667	Simulations using centriolar entry of STIL–HsSAS6 and exogenous perturbation.#####(A)  Representative simulation results using the entry of the STIL–HsSAS6 complex.##### (B)  Representative simulation results using overexpression of Plk4 or STIL.#####Representative experimental data showing similar patterns are shown at the bottom.#####The arrowheads in the images indicate the duplicated centrioles.#####Scale bar, 1 µm.
2019	PMC6829667	Next, we simulated a perturbation of centriole duplication through overexpression of the components and compared the simulated results with experimental results to further verify this model.#####Overexpression of Plk4, STIL, or HsSAS6 is known to induce overduplication of centrioles ( Habedanck et al., 2005 ;  Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007 ;  Strnad et al., 2007 ;  Tang et al., 2011 ;  Arquint et al., 2012 ;  Vulprecht et al., 2012 ).#####In simulations using overexpression of Plk4 (the cytosolic level of Plk4 was set five times higher), multiple Plk4 foci tended to remain even after STIL–HsSAS6 loading.#####This was consistent with the experimental results ( Fig. 4 B ).#####This is due to increased influx of Plk4 into the centriole, resulting in multiple foci retaining Plk4 quantities above the threshold of STIL binding.#####Despite this increased influx, the LI effect remained.#####Interestingly, under overexpression of Plk4, the simulated Plk4 patterns were relatively unstable throughout the time course ( Fig. 4 B ), until they were stabilized via the entry of STIL.#####Overexpression of STIL was then simulated by setting a lower threshold (one fifth) of STIL binding to Plk4 foci.#####Under this condition, several Plk4 foci tended to remain after STIL–HsSAS6 loading, which was also consistent with our experimental observations ( Fig. 4 B ).#####Interestingly, the numbers of stabilized Plk4 foci in the overexpression simulations did not exceed six, potentially explaining the limitation in the maximum number of overduplicated daughter centrioles.#####Indeed, most previous studies have convincingly demonstrated that six is the maximum number of daughter centrioles that can be formed on a single mother centriole ( Habedanck et al., 2005 ;  Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007 ;  Strnad et al., 2007 ;  Tang et al., 2011 ;  Arquint et al., 2012 ;  Vulprecht et al., 2012 ), although it is also possible that this may be merely because of space limitations.#####Importantly, we provide the first theoretical explanation and prediction of the mechanisms involved in centriole overduplication.
2019	PMC6829667	Together, we conclude that the model successfully reproduced our observations regardless of experimental conditions.#####This further supports our self-patterning theory ( Fig. 3 A ).
2019	PMC6829667	Assuming that Plk4 is converted into its active form via autophosphorylation, inhibition of its kinase activity may decelerate the activation of Plk4 and diminishes the LI effect ( Fig. 3 A ).#####Using lower activation rates, our model predicted that Plk4 would occupy all of the available slots and exhibit 12 foci symmetrically arranged around a centriole (data not shown).#####In contrast, upon treatment with the Plk4 inhibitor centrinone ( Wong et al., 2015 ), Plk4 exhibited ninefold rotationally symmetrical spatial patterns in our STED observations (Fig. S3 A).#####Interestingly, in the presence of centrinone, the middle part of CEP152 exhibited patterns closer to ninefold symmetry (40° intervals), whereas the N-terminal part continued to hold ∼12 slots (30° intervals) at the centriole (Fig. S3 B).#####Collectively, these findings suggest that the inhibition of kinase activity changes the mode of Plk4–CEP152 interaction.#####Considering the somewhat unclear periodicity of CEP152, further investigation using electron microscopy or perhaps expansion microscopy ( Chen et al., 2015 ;  Chang et al., 2017 ), besides STED microscopy, may provide more information about the relationship between the activity of Plk4 and its scaffold.
2019	PMC6829667	As schematically shown in  Fig. 5 , our theory explains the involvement of molecular dynamics in the determination of centriole duplication sites.#####In this model, Plk4 first forms randomly distributed seeds, and subsequent competition via the LI effect results in the appearance of discrete ring patterns.#####The model also includes the self-assembly property of Plk4 ( Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ), by which condensed Plk4 attenuates its dissociation rate.#####Therefore, the slot that recruits the greatest quantity of Plk4 at the onset is favored, in that it prevents neighboring slots from recruiting Plk4 molecules and tends to survive as the largest Plk4 focus via first-come-first-served and the-rich-grow-richer processes (“Self-patterning” in  Fig. 5 ).#####Through stochastic means, STIL and HsSAS6 preferentially bind to the largest Plk4 focus in the discrete ring, leading to stabilization.#####This assumption is reasonable, given that stochastic interactions between Plk4 and STIL–HsSAS6 are probably biased such that the more Plk4 there is in a focus, the more frequently the molecules interact with each other.#####Increasing expression levels of STIL in turn promote the degradation of cytosolic Plk4, resulting in decreased entry of Plk4 into the centriole.#####Given that the population of phosphorylated Plk4 in centrioles increases after centriolar loading of the STIL–HsSAS6 complex ( Ohta et al., 2018 ;  Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ), it is also conceivable that the negative-feedback regulation based on the Plk4–STIL interaction promotes the dissociation/degradation of Plk4 around the mother centriole wall, except at the duplication site ( Ohta et al., 2018 ).#####Consequently, the largest Plk4 focus remains as the only site of centriole duplication.
2019	PMC6829667	Model of centriole duplication.##### The self-patterning theory explains how the self-organization properties of Plk4 result in the formation of the biased discrete ring patterns to provide the single centriole duplication sites.
2019	PMC6829667	According to our self-patterning theory, Plk4 can independently form periodic discrete patterns, i.e., potential duplication sites.#####Most importantly, because of its intrinsic properties, Plk4 alone can generate bias from random seeds in the periphery of preexisting centrioles, suggesting that this is the first spontaneous symmetry breaking in centriole duplication.#####However, the self-patterning of Plk4 exhibits fluctuation and plasticity until it is stabilized by STIL and HsSAS6.#####Indeed, recent theoretical work has suggested the importance of a STIL-mediated mechanism in the symmetry breaking of Plk4 ( Leda et al., 2018 ).#####Their model has similarities with ours in autoamplification and competition mechanisms, while the scope is different.#####The core concept of our models is that the intrinsic properties of Plk4 can drive the symmetry breaking, which is essential as the biased pattern of Plk4 can be observed before centriolar loading of STIL, and even in STIL-depleted cells ( Ohta et al., 2014 ;  Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019 ).#####However, apart from the initial symmetry-breaking event, both models may come to the same conclusion, that the STIL-mediated mechanism plays a critical role in completing the site selection for centriole duplication.#####Such a two-step process—the self-patterning of Plk4 and the subsequent stabilization by STIL and/or HsSAS6—may serve as backup and buffer mechanisms to ensure the precise regulation of centriole duplication.#####In biological systems, it is commonly observed that initial symmetry-breaking steps induce weak bias, and subsequent feedback mechanisms robustly fix the asymmetry ( Goryachev and Leda, 2017 ;  Chen et al., 2018 ;  Kim et al., 2018 ).#####Instead of forming the definitive duplication site from the beginning, the weakly biased ring patterns of Plk4 may provide backup sites, while the entry of STIL–HsSAS6 ensures that only one site is determined for centriole duplication.#####In this regard, it is interesting that the spatiotemporal patterning of Plk4 may be more dynamic, depending on the parameters used in simulations ( Fig. 3 C , Example 3).#####Thus, our theory predicts the possibility that potential centriole duplication sites switch dynamically within the periphery of centrioles, although such a system may be too unstable.#####The development of future techniques enabling live-cell super-resolution imaging may provide the answer.#####Alternatively, addition of other concepts, such as liquid–liquid phase separation ( Woodruff et al., 2017 ), may significantly improve our models.#####While our theory sheds light on numerous experimental observations, further research based on both experimental data and further improvement of the present models may assist in reaching definitive conclusions.
2019	PMC6829667	Assuming that Plk4 is converted into its active form via autophosphorylation, inhibition of its kinase activity may decelerate the activation of Plk4 and diminishes the LI effect ( Fig. 3 A ).#####Using lower activation rates, our model predicted that Plk4 would occupy all of the available slots and exhibit 12 foci symmetrically arranged around a centriole (data not shown).#####In contrast, upon treatment with the Plk4 inhibitor centrinone ( Wong et al., 2015 ), Plk4 exhibited ninefold rotationally symmetrical spatial patterns in our STED observations (Fig. S3 A).#####Interestingly, in the presence of centrinone, the middle part of CEP152 exhibited patterns closer to ninefold symmetry (40° intervals), whereas the N-terminal part continued to hold ∼12 slots (30° intervals) at the centriole (Fig. S3 B).#####Collectively, these findings suggest that the inhibition of kinase activity changes the mode of Plk4–CEP152 interaction.#####Considering the somewhat unclear periodicity of CEP152, further investigation using electron microscopy or perhaps expansion microscopy ( Chen et al., 2015 ;  Chang et al., 2017 ), besides STED microscopy, may provide more information about the relationship between the activity of Plk4 and its scaffold.
