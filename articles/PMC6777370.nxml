How the core components cooperate to achieve high fidelity in centriole duplication remains poorly understood. By live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged proteins in human cells throughout the entire cell cycle, we quantitatively tracked the dynamics of the critical duplication factors: Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6. Centriolar Plk4 peaks and then starts decreasing during the late G1 phase, which coincides with the accumulation of STIL at centrioles. Shortly thereafter, the HsSAS6 level increases steeply at the procentriole assembly site. We also show that both STIL and HsSAS6 are necessary for attenuating Plk4 levels. Furthermore, our mathematical modeling and simulation suggest that the STIL-HsSAS6 complex in the cartwheel has a negative feedback effect on centriolar Plk4. Combined, these findings illustrate how the dynamic behavior of and interactions between critical duplication factors coordinate the centriole-duplication process.</p><p><uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1242/bio.047670">This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper</uri>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p><bold>Summary</bold><bold>:</bold> The findings in this study illustrate how the dynamic behavior and interactions between critical duplication factors coordinate the centriole-duplication process in human cells, based on live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged proteins and mathematical modeling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEY WORDS</title><kwd>Centriole duplication</kwd><kwd>Live imaging</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9</kwd><kwd>Mathematical modeling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010449</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Daiichi Sankyo Foundation of Life Science</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005927</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Prize Foundation</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004016</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Centrosomes and their core components, centrioles, are duplicated once during the cell cycle, which allows bipolar spindle assembly and ensures the proper proliferation of most animal cells (<xref rid="BIO047175C26" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C13" ref-type="bibr">G&#x000f6;nczy and Hatzopoulos, 2019</xref>). Despite its significance, the precise mechanisms regulating centriole duplication are largely unknown. In human cells, three centriolar proteins, namely Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), STIL and HsSAS6, have been identified as the core components that coordinate the onset of centriole duplication (<xref rid="BIO047175C6" ref-type="bibr">Banterle and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C26" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). Observations based on immunofluorescence microscopy have revealed a sequential accumulation of these components at centrioles during the duplication process. In the early G1 phase of the cell cycle, Plk4 first appears as a biased ring-like pattern surrounding the centrioles where STIL and HsSAS6 are still absent (<xref rid="BIO047175C15" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). It has been suggested that the intrinsic properties of Plk4 drive this initial bias, thus providing a potential site for procentriole assembly independent of the centriolar loading of STIL and HsSAS6 (<xref rid="BIO047175C38" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, the ring-like pattern of Plk4 changes dynamically into a single focus containing both STIL and HsSAS6 (<xref rid="BIO047175C3" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This is achieved by Plk4 binding to and phosphorylating STIL/Ana2, which subsequently stimulates the kinase activity of Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C23" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C10" ref-type="bibr">Dzhindzhev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C21" ref-type="bibr">McLamarrah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>). The phosphorylation by Plk4 of the STAN motif in STIL/Ana2 promotes the formation of a complex between the phosphorylated STIL/Ana2 and HsSAS6/DSas-6, presumably leading to the cartwheel assembly (<xref rid="BIO047175C9" ref-type="bibr">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C18" ref-type="bibr">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C23" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C3" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, complex interactions between these components cause positive and negative regulation, which mediate the local restriction of Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6 at the procentriole assembly site to allow for procentriole formation (<xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C3" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Such sequential accumulation of the components into the centrioles has been observed mainly with fixed cells. To achieve a fundamental understanding of centriole duplication processes, however, the dynamics of the components (e.g. timing, correlation and the interdependency of centriolar accumulation) need to be more precisely analyzed. While live imaging has been successfully used to visualize the dynamics of these components at centrioles throughout the entire cell cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="BIO047175C4" ref-type="bibr">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> preprint) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="BIO047175C8" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et al., 2008</xref>) embryos, gaining insight into these dynamic processes in human cells has remained challenging. In this study, we use optimized live imaging throughout the entire cell cycle in cultured human cells to precisely analyze and describe the dynamics of endogenous proteins participating in centriole duplication. We also simulate the dynamic processes and propose a model that explains how the dynamics of these components cooperatively organize centriole duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Distinct time courses of centriolar accumulation of endogenous Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6 during the cell cycle</title><p>To track the behavior of endogenous proteins in live cells, we observed HCT116 cell lines by spinning disc confocal microscopy, as previously described (<xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>). Since centriole duplication is sensitive to the expression level of the core components (e.g. overexpression of a component is known to induce overduplication of centrioles), we used endogenous tagging of target proteins. However, given the limited number of copies of endogenous centriole duplication components (<xref rid="BIO047175C7" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2016</xref>), the signal from an endogenous fluorescent tag could be too weak to detect in live imaging. To address this issue, as previously demonstrated in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="BIO047175C4" ref-type="bibr">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> preprint) and cultured human cells (<xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>), we successfully used spinning disc confocal microscopy with an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera to track the dynamics of endogenous proteins at centrioles. This avoided significant photobleaching of the fluorescent tag and phototoxicity to the cells throughout the entire cell cycle. In addition to Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>), we also endogenously tagged STIL and HsSAS6 with fluorescent proteins at their C-termini using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with optimized C-terminal tagging vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S6</uri>) (<xref rid="BIO047175C24" ref-type="bibr">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>). In the live-cell imaging, Z-stacks of fluorescence images were acquired every 10&#x02005;min for up to 30&#x02005;h. The cells that normally lasted at least one entire cell cycle (typically around 16&#x02005;h for HCT116 cells) in the total image acquisition period were used for all data analyses, to ensure that we used only cells that had entered their next cell cycle without phototoxicity.

This oscillation has been shown to reflect the changes in the spatial pattern of centriolar Plk4, i.e. from the ring-like to the single-focus pattern (<xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>), as schematically shown in the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A. We typically tracked fluorescence signals for a period covering two oscillations in order to confirm that cells enter the next cell cycle without phototoxic effects. Although fluorescence signals gradually decreased over time courses, presumably due to photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A), the decrease was subtle and at least one complete oscillation cycle was successfully tracked in each observation. To further verify the behavior of Plk4-mClover at centrioles, we monitored the effect of treatment with a Plk4 inhibitor, centrinone (<xref rid="BIO047175C36" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Centrinone treatment is known to promote centriolar accumulation of Plk4 in a few hours, presumably by inhibiting dissociation and/or degradation of Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the centriolar Plk4-mClover signal increased five- to tenfold immediately following the addition of centrinone, regardless of the stage of interphase (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>), suggesting that centriolar accumulation of Plk4 is tightly regulated by its phosphorylation state during interphase. Interestingly, during mitosis, the Plk4-mClover signal decreased, even in the presence of centrinone (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>).</p><p>We then similarly observed the dynamics of STIL-mCherry and HsSAS6-mCherry at centrioles throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C,D). In contrast to Plk4-mClover, which started increasing immediately after mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B), the fluorescence intensity of STIL-mCherry and HsSAS6-mCherry started increasing about 2&#x02013;5&#x02005;h after mitotic exit, and decreased just before the next mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>C,D). This is consistent with previous observations, in which endogenous or exogenously-expressed STIL and HsSAS6 were absent from centrioles during the early G1 phase (<xref rid="BIO047175C31" ref-type="bibr">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C2" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C1" ref-type="bibr">Arquint and Nigg, 2014</xref>). To further investigate whether STIL and HsSAS6 are indeed absent from centrioles during the post-mitotic time window, we attempted to detect signals with higher sensitivity by switching tags from mCherry to mClover, one of the brightest fluorescent proteins. Both time courses were quite similar (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig. S2A,B</uri>), but on closer inspection a weak centriolar signal of HsSAS6-mClover was detectable during and immediately after mitosis (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2C</uri>). It is surprising that HsSAS6 is already present around centrioles during the early G1 phase, albeit at very low levels. This discrepancy from previous observations may stem from differences in the immunofluorescence protocols. One possibility is that the centriolar fraction of HsSAS6 during the early G1 phase is not in a rigid structure like cartwheels, so these molecules would not be retained at centrioles during the fixation procedure. This observation aside, the majority of the centriolar HsSAS6 we observed started accumulating at the centrioles later in the cell cycle, regardless of the tags we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2B</uri>), as previously observed via immunofluorescence (<xref rid="BIO047175C14" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C31" ref-type="bibr">Strnad et al., 2007</xref>). This centriolar HsSAS6 thus probably corresponds to the stack of cartwheels, at least in part. The meaning of the fraction of centriolar HsSAS6 that is present during the early G1 phase is yet to be addressed. It is possible that it provides the seed for the onset of cartwheel assembly. Alternatively, it could merely be a meaningless fraction that happens to be trapped in the crowded pericentriolar environment (<xref rid="BIO047175C11" ref-type="bibr">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C19" ref-type="bibr">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C22" ref-type="bibr">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C29" ref-type="bibr">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C37" ref-type="bibr">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless, this approach of optimized live-cell imaging with endogenous tagging illustrates the distinct dynamics of critical centriole duplication factors throughout the cell cycle in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Centriolar accumulation of STIL coincides with the onset of the drop in Plk4, shortly followed by the steep increase in centriolar HsSAS6</title><p>We then sought to investigate how the centriolar dynamics of the core duplication components correlate with each other.

Thus, centriolar accumulation of STIL probably triggers the decrease in centriolar Plk4.

For Plk4-mClover and STIL-mCherry, this time lag was on average 4.1&#x02005;h, and for Plk4-mClover and HsSAS6-mCherry, it was on average 5.6&#x02005;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>D). It is therefore likely that after a certain amount of STIL has accumulated at a Plk4 focus around centrioles, HsSAS6 begins stacking cartwheels on the focus. The centriolar STIL level, similarly to that of HsSAS6, kept increasing after the drop in centriolar Plk4, suggesting that STIL and HsSAS6 are coordinately incorporated into the stack of cartwheels.</p><p>Combined, these results suggest the following: (1) elevated loading of STIL triggers the pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 from the ring-like to the single-focus pattern; (2) following the gradual accumulation of phosphorylated STIL, and once the local concentration of HsSAS6 at the centrioles exceeds the threshold for cartwheel formation, the STIL&#x02013;HsSAS6 complex is coordinately integrated into a stack of cartwheels; and (3) this transition leads to a stable and continuous reduction in Plk4 at the centrioles, which may contribute significantly to the formation of a single procentriole site. STIL may thus play multiple roles as a hub in these sequential processes during centriole duplication.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Both STIL and HsSAS6 are required, in an interdependent manner, for the spatial-pattern shift of centriolar Plk4</title><p>Since STIL and HsSAS6 are thought to induce the spatial-pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C3" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), we then observed the behavior of centriolar Plk4 in cells depleted of STIL or HsSAS6 (as well as in a control culture). In live-cell imaging of endogenous Plk4-mClover after mitotic exit, the onset of centriolar accumulation and the time until it reached its peak fluorescence intensity were similar in all three conditions, although the accumulation rates seemed slightly faster in siSTIL- or siHsSAS6-treated cells than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). In stark contrast, upon depletion of STIL or HsSAS6, centriolar Plk4-mClover remained constant after reaching its fluorescence peak throughout the rest of the period until the next mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). The peak intensity of centriolar Plk4-mClover fluorescence in these conditions was comparable to that in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). These results suggest that, in STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted cells, Plk4 forms the centriolar ring after mitotic exit as normal, but the pattern shift to a single focus never takes place. Indeed, when observed by immunofluorescence microscopy at a higher resolution, in line with previous observations (<xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>), centriolar Plk4 primarily exhibited its ring-like pattern in STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>B).

Taken together, these data show that both STIL and HsSAS6 are required for the pattern shift of centriolar Plk4 to a single focus but are dispensable for the initial formation of the ring-like pattern of Plk4.</p><p>Centriolar accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6 is known to be interdependent (<xref rid="BIO047175C33" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C2" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C35" ref-type="bibr">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>). We confirmed by using immunofluorescence microscopy that STIL is mostly absent from centrioles in cells that are depleted of HsSAS6 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>D). Therefore, STIL and HsSAS6 may cooperatively stabilize the centriolar Plk4 focus, with slightly different time courses, to provide a single site for procentriole formation. Interestingly, the ring-filling indices for Plk4 differed slightly between siSTIL- and siHsSAS6-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>C). This may reflect differences in the roles of STIL and HsSAS6 in the spatial regulation of Plk4 at centrioles, although further investigation is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Centriolar accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6 may regulate the dynamics of centriolar Plk4 to generate a single site for procentriole formation</title><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying procentriole formation with respect to the dynamic behavior of the participating components, we constructed a mathematical model to reproduce the experimental results by simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A). Plk4 possesses intrinsic self-organization properties, such as self-assembly and the promotion of dissociation/degradation (hereafter collectively referred to as dissociation) of Plk4 molecules in an autophosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref rid="BIO047175C38" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019</xref>). Based on these properties, as in the previous model simulating the spatial patterning of centriolar Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C32" ref-type="bibr">Takao et al., 2019</xref>), the present model assumes that the autophosphorylation-mediated activation of Plk4 promotes its dissociation from the centriole. STIL promotes the kinase activity of Plk4 and thus the dissociation of centriolar Plk4. STIL also attenuates the dissociation of phosphorylated Plk4 via direct binding. This complex regulation is thought to be mediated by the bimodal binding of STIL to Plk4 (<xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, centriolar loading of STIL is mediated by Plk4 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Given that HsSAS6 can be detected at centrioles during the early G1 phase (<uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S2C</uri>), centrioles can recruit HsSAS6 just after mitotic exit, but may not be able to retain much of it at that stage. Since the steep increase in centriolar STIL preceded that of HsSAS6 and continued in concert with it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Figs&#x000a0;S3</uri> and <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">S4</uri>), the model assumes that phosphorylated STIL mediates the cartwheel assembly via direct interaction with HsSAS6. In addition, it may be reasonable to assume that HsSAS6 is retained at centrioles once it has formed a closed ring and been incorporated into the stable cartwheel structure, resulting in a drastic increase in the centriolar HsSAS6 level. The formation of cartwheel structures may also require phosphorylated STIL as part of the stable structure, thus preventing it from dissociating. Via the interaction network described above, in our model Plk4, STIL and HsSAS6 cooperatively generate a single site for procentriole formation.

For simplicity, we have displayed the total quantity of each component at the centriole in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B, although the actual simulation included subclasses of components (e.g. the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Plk4; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Fig.&#x000a0;S5</uri>). Our live-cell imaging did not distinguish between such subclasses, so it is the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B that should be compared with the live-cell imaging data. The simulated time courses were quite similar to those in our actual observations, and the parametric plots (Plk4 versus STIL or HsSAS6) from the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>C) also resembled the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A,B; <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">Figs&#x000a0;S3</uri> and <uri xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/doi/10.1242/bio.047175.supplemental">S4</uri>). The model could therefore convincingly reproduce the experimental data obtained under normal physiological conditions.</p><p>We then compared the simulation data with the experimental data obtained under STIL- or HsSAS6-depleted conditions. In both cases, the increased level of Plk4 was maintained over time after it had reached its peak and the onset of Plk4 accumulation was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D). Centriolar accumulation of HsSAS6 was significantly attenuated with the depletion of STIL and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>D). Thus, the simulations based on our model also convincingly reproduced the experimental data obtained under perturbed conditions.</p><p>As has been previously proposed (<xref rid="BIO047175C3" ref-type="bibr">Arquint et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C28" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), the spatial-pattern shift of Plk4 from the pericentriolar ring to a single focus is mediated by STIL and HsSAS6. However, how exactly the coordinated action of the three components creates a single site for procentriole assembly remains elusive. Based on both experimental observations and simulations, we propose a model of procentriole formation as schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BIO047175F4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>E. Our live-cell imaging of single cells throughout the cell cycle demonstrated that the centriolar loading of both STIL and HsSAS6 is tightly associated with, and indeed required for, the rapid decrease in Plk4 after it has reached its fluorescence peak. Our mathematical modeling and simulation faithfully reproduce these processes. The significance of STIL in the spatial patterning of centriolar Plk4 has also been demonstrated using another mathematical model, which assumes different behavior and interactions of Plk4, STIL and their phosphatases (<xref rid="BIO047175C20" ref-type="bibr">Leda et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, immediately after mitotic exit, HsSAS6 can already be recruited to centrioles, presumably in the free dimer state, despite its low levels (Fig.&#x000a0;4E; Fig.&#x000a0;S2C). It exhibits a high dissociation constant for the self-assembly of N-terminal head domains to form a ninefold symmetric ring (<xref rid="BIO047175C34" ref-type="bibr">van Breugel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C16" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et al., 2011</xref>), however, these low levels may not be sufficient to initiate cartwheel assembly. Phosphorylated STIL promotes centriolar accumulation of HsSAS6 by forming a complex that is thought to be a crucial process in cartwheel assembly (<xref rid="BIO047175C23" ref-type="bibr">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C18" ref-type="bibr">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C27" ref-type="bibr">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). We thus hypothesize that once the local concentration of HsSAS6 dimers exceeds the threshold for forming a closed, rigid ring as the center of the cartwheel structure, increasing numbers of HsSAS6 dimers flow into the stream of the building stack of cartwheels. This is analogous to a previous model based on an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution assay using <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> SAS6 and mathematical modeling, which suggested that the cartwheel assembly mechanism was mediated by the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> protein Bld10p (<xref rid="BIO047175C17" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C12" ref-type="bibr">Goldie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="BIO047175C25" ref-type="bibr">Nievergelt et al., 2018</xref>). Given that STIL is thought to be a part of the cartwheel structure (<xref rid="BIO047175C30" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2010</xref>), this system acts as a positive feedback loop for the accumulation of the STIL&#x02013;HsSAS6 complex at centrioles. Concurrently, at the procentriole assembly site, this increased quantity of the protein complex may suppress the dissociation of active Plk4 from centrioles via direct interaction, while promoting the activation and subsequent dissociation of neighboring Plk4 molecules from centrioles. In this way, it is possible that the structural integrity of assembling cartwheels is directly linked with the negative feedback loop that completely suppresses the formation of extra procentrioles. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that artificially induced degradation of centriolar HsSAS6 after cartwheel formation can cause re-assembly of Plk4 rings (<xref rid="BIO047175C39" ref-type="bibr">Yoshiba et al., 2019</xref>). Our data and these arguments suggest that positive and negative regulation within the Plk4&#x02013;STIL&#x02013;HsSAS6 network ensures accurate site selection for the formation of a single procentriole.</p><p>Recent work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos has precisely described the dynamics of centriolar proteins including Plk4 and Sas6 (<xref rid="BIO047175C4" ref-type="bibr">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> preprint). The time course of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Plk4 is similar to that indicated by this study, although the cell cycle is much shorter (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;20&#x02005;min) and the onset of centriolar Sas6 accumulation occurs before Plk4 reaches its peak (<xref rid="BIO047175C4" ref-type="bibr">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> preprint). However, given that Plk4 appears as a ring only in late mitosis, when Sas6 begins to be recruited to centrioles, similar regulation to that indicated in our study may be occurring at the onset of centriole duplication. In line with this, there seems to be a small Plk4 peak around mitotic exit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref rid="BIO047175C4" ref-type="bibr">Aydogan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="BIO047175C5" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref> preprint). Despite the homology, the precise mechanisms regulating the rate and timing of each process may differ depending on the cell, tissue type and species. Further research, including optical imaging and molecular analyses of the protein dynamics, structural analyses and computational analyses, will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of centriole duplication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Key resources</title><sec id="s3a1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Plk4 (1:250; Merck, MABC544),</p><p>STIL (1:500; Abcam, ab89314),</p><p>HsSAS6 (1:500; Santa Cruz, sc-81431),</p><p>CEP152-N (1:1000; Bethyl, A302-479A),</p><p>Pericentrin (1:1000, Abcam, ab4448 or ab28144).</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>siRNAs</title><p>STIL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Silencer Select #s12863),</p><p>HsSAS6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Silencer Select #s46487),</p><p>Negative control (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Silencer Select #4390843).</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Centrinone (MedChem Express, HY-18682).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s3b1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (GE Healthcare) supplied with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
