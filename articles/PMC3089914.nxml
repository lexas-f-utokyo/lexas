In addition, centrioles are important for assembling the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of animal cells, and as such, they are critical for genome stability. As anticipated from these important roles, aberrations in centriole structure or function are implicated in a number of disease conditions, including ciliopathies, male sterility, primary microcephaly, and cancer (reviewed in <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>). Therefore, increased understanding of centriole biology is expected to also result in important clinical implications.</p><p>Centrioles, and the related basal bodies, are barrel-shaped microtubule-containing structures characterized by a universal 9-fold radial symmetry that they also impart to cilia and flagella (reviewed in <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010</xref>). In most species, the centriole is organized around a cartwheel that comprises a central hub &#x0223c;25&#x000a0;nm in diameter from which nine spokes radiate outward and connect to nine microtubule blades (reviewed in <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Strnad and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2008</xref>). The molecular and structural principles directing the universal 9-fold symmetry of the cartwheel and the centriole remain to be discovered.</p><p>The genetic material duplicates once and only once per cell cycle, and so do centrioles. In contrast to the mechanisms governing DNA replication, however, those at the root of centriole formation are poorly understood. This is despite the fact that five proteins that are essential for centriole formation have been identified initially in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib6 bib8 bib16 bib19 bib23 bib22 bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Delattre et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Kemp et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Kirkham et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Leidel et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Leidel and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2003; O'Connell et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Pelletier et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Relatives of these components are present and similarly required for centriole formation across eukaryotic evolution, indicating that they constitute an ancient core module that is essential for centriole formation (reviewed in <xref rid="bib28 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009; Strnad and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Among these five components, SAS-6 is of particular interest to consider for investigating the mechanisms governing centriole formation for a number of reasons. First, proteins of the SAS-6 family are required for the earliest steps of centriole formation from <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref rid="bib5 bib23 bib27 bib32 bib37 bib38" ref-type="bibr">Culver et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Leidel et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Nakazawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Rodrigues-Martins et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Strnad et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Yabe et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Second, overexpression of SAS-6 proteins induces the formation of multiple new centrioles adjacent to the existing one in human cells (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Strnad et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), as well as centriole amplification and de novo formation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues-Martins et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, combined overexpression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes of DSas-6 and the interacting protein Ana2 results in the formation of structures that resemble the cartwheel (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Third, SAS-6 proteins localize to the cartwheel in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib18 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kilburn&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Nakazawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), to the proximal part of the new centriole in <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (<xref rid="bib21 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kleylein-Sohn et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Strnad et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and to the functionally related central tube in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib7 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Pelletier et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that proteins of the SAS-6 family are somehow important for the onset of centriole formation, although whether they can initiate this process on their own or must rely on additional factors to do so is not known. Overall, although it has been hypothesized that SAS-6 proteins may be critical for forming the central hub of the cartwheel (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Strnad and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2008</xref>), the actual mechanisms by which they ensure cartwheel assembly and thus centriole formation have remained elusive.</p><p>In this study, using a combination of biophysical, biochemical, structural, and cell biological approaches, we establish that self-assembly of SAS-6 homodimers is at the root of the universal 9-fold symmetry of the cartwheel and thus of centrioles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Structural and Biophysical Characterization of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6</title><p>We first set out to characterize the structure of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6 to uncover the mechanisms by which it contributes to centriole formation. Proteins of the SAS-6 family comprise an N-terminal domain with the evolutionarily conserved PISA motif, followed by a segment with a predicted coiled coil and a less-conserved C-terminal region predicted to be disordered (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). We expressed and purified soluble SAS-6 full-length (ceFL), the N terminus plus the coiled coil (ceN-CC), or the coiled-coil domain alone (ceCC) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B available online) and analyzed them by biophysical and structural methods. Inspection by electron microscopy revealed an &#x0223c;35&#x000a0;nm elongated rod in all three constructs, which fits the predicted length of the SAS-6 coiled coil (&#x0223c;220 residues &#x000d7; 0.1485&#x000a0;nm [axial raise per residue]&#x000a0;= &#x0223c;32.7&#x000a0;nm) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Full-length SAS-6 and ceN-CC were decorated with a globular head-like moiety at one end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, arrowheads), which is absent in ceCC, indicating that it corresponded to the N-terminal domain of SAS-6. No significant difference could be observed between ceFL and ceN-CC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B), supporting the prediction that the C terminus does not adopt a globular structure.</p><p>We analyzed the ceCC fragment further to uncover its stability&#x000a0;and molecular architecture. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed a far-ultraviolet spectrum and a cooperative thermal unfolding profile that is characteristic of moderately stable &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D) (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Steinmetz et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). To assess the oligomerization state of the coiled-coil domain, we conducted multiangle light scattering (MALS) experiments, which yielded a molecular mass that is consistent with a dimer (50&#x000a0;kDa versus a ceCC monomeric mass of 27.4&#x000a0;kDa; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). The stability of the ceCC coiled-coil dimer was estimated by measuring the change in CD signal at 222&#x000a0;nm upon dilution. Fitting of the data revealed a dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, of 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F). To determine the relative orientation of the two ceCC monomers within the dimer, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing conditions. Cys204 is the only cysteine residue in the coiled coil and is predicted to occupy a heptad a core position, such that the ceCC fragment should form a disulphide bond only if the two fragments are in a parallel and in-register configuration (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>C and S1D). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>G, ceCC was indeed crosslinked under nonreducing conditions, indicating a parallel arrangement of monomers in SAS-6 homodimers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>H).</p><p>Next, we determined the structure of the N-terminal globular domain of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6 (ceN; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B) by X-ray crystallography. We obtained crystals of a ceN variant and solved its structure to 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained a dimer of ceN monomers with local 2-fold symmetry (ceN-dimer) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). The fold of ceN is reminiscent of that of the XRCC4 family of DNA repair proteins (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Junop et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). We noted that a striking interaction interface in the ceN-dimer was mediated by I154 at the tip of the &#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7 loop of one monomer, which was inserted deeply into a hydrophobic cavity of the second monomer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). Both I154 and the residues shaping the hydrophobic cavity are well conserved among SAS-6 orthologs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), suggesting functional relevance. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments conducted at 300&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M protein concentration demonstrated that the ceN fragment could also form a dimer in solution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments yielded a K<sub>d</sub> for the N-N interaction of &#x0223c;110 &#x000b1; 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A), two orders of magnitude higher than that of the ceCC coiled coil. To address whether I154 mediates ceN-dimer formation, we substituted this residue for the charged residue glutamate (ceN[I154E]). Although the conformation of the domain was not altered by this mutation (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3</xref>B and S3C), AUC experiments revealed that this change abrogated dimer formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). We conclude that I154 is critical for mediating the N-N interaction.</p><p>Interestingly, inspection of the ceN-dimer structure suggested that the &#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7 loop encompassing I154 might promote an interaction between SAS-6 homodimers, as this residue is located diametrically across the ceN domain's C terminus, which proceeds into the coiled coil (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). To test this hypothesis, we conducted AUC experiments with the ceN-CC fragment, which could be more readily expressed and purified in an intact form than ceFL (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>D). AUC of ceN-CC conducted at 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M protein concentration revealed the presence of higher-order oligomers besides dimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F). In contrast, a mutant in which I154 had been exchanged by glutamate (ceN-CC[I154E]) only formed dimers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F).</p><p>Together, our structural and biophysical data establish that assembly of higher-order SAS-6 oligomeric structures occurs in two steps. First, elongated SAS-6 homodimers assemble, driven by the strong interaction between the helices of the two-stranded parallel coiled coil. Second, oligomers of SAS-6 homodimers assemble, a step that is mediated by the weaker interaction between pairs of N-terminal globular domains located in adjacent homodimers.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Biological Significance of SAS-6 Oligomerization</title><p>To investigate the biological significance of the oligomerization of SAS-6 homodimers mediated by the N-N interaction, we generated transgenic worms expressing GFP fused to SAS-6[I154E] engineered so as to be resistant to RNAi directed against endogenous SAS-6 (GFP-SAS-6RR[I154E]) (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dammermann et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). A similar approach was utilized to replace I154 by glycine, a smaller and noncharged residue, thus generating GFP-SAS-6RR[I154G]. Upon <italic>sas-6</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) in an otherwise wild-type background, the two paternally contributed centrioles split from one another and assembled a bipolar spindle at the end of the one-cell stage (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>). In contrast, a monopolar spindle usually assembled in each blastomere at the end of the second cell cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>G). In <italic>sas-6</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) embryos expressing RNAi-resistant wild-type SAS-6 fused to GFP (GFP-SAS-6RR), &#x0223c;40% of embryos underwent bipolar spindle assembly in each blastomere at the end of the second cell cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and 3G and <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S2</xref>) (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). This reflected rescue of centriole formation, as demonstrated by the presence of the centriolar protein SAS-4 in each spindle pole (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). Partial rescue to only &#x0223c;40% is likely due to GFP at the N terminus interfering with the function of SAS-6 and to levels of the fusion protein being lower than that of the endogenous protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>H) (see also <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, there was no rescue of centriole formation in <italic>sas-6</italic>(<italic>RNAi</italic>) embryos expressing GFP-SAS-6RR[I154E] or GFP-SAS-6RR[I154G] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B, 3C, and 3E&#x02013;3G and <xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S3</xref>). This was not due to differences in expression levels; in fact, GFP-SAS-6RR[I154E] and GFP-SAS-6RR[I154G] were expressed at slightly higher levels than wild-type GFP-SAS-6RR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>H). We conclude that I154 is essential for centriole formation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic>.</p><p>We then addressed whether the importance of oligomerization mediated by the N-N interaction is evolutionarily conserved. To this end, we analyzed the human protein HsSAS-6, in which the residue corresponding to <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> I154 is F131 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). We generated constructs in which wild-type or F131E mutant HsSAS-6 was fused to GFP and expressed from a doxycycline-inducible promoter (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bach et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The fusion constructs do not contain the 3&#x02032;UTR of the endogenous gene, so we targeted this region using siRNAs to deplete solely endogenous HsSAS-6 without affecting the GFP fusion proteins (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>E). Whereas &#x0223c;95% of control mitotic cells harbored the usual number of &#x02265; 4 centrioles marked by the EF-hand protein centrin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>L), this was the case for only &#x0223c;10% of mitotic cells treated with siHsSAS-6-3&#x02032;UTR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I and 3L). Expression of wild-type HsSAS-6-GFP in cells treated with siHsSAS-6-3&#x02032;UTR resulted in substantial rescue of centriole formation, with &#x0003e; 80% of mitotic cells harboring &#x02265; 4 centrioles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>J and 3L). By contrast, cells expressing HsSAS-6[F131E]-GFP and subjected to siHsSAS-6-3&#x02032;UTR did not exhibit rescue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>K and 3L).</p><p>Together, these experiments demonstrate that a singly conserved residue mediating the SAS-6 N-N interaction is essential for centriole formation in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> and in human cells, indicating that the capacity to oligomerize is critical for the function of SAS-6 proteins across evolution.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Root of the 9-Fold Symmetry of Centrioles</title><p>To understand the function of SAS-6 oligomerization for centriole formation at the structural level, we investigated the molecular properties of a SAS-6 protein from an organism in which the cartwheel has a canonical structure. This is the case in human cells (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Guichard et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), but recombinant HsSAS-6 and fragments thereof were not soluble (data not shown). By contrast, we were able to produce soluble recombinant proteins from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> Bld12p (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nakazawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), which has the same domain organization as other SAS-6 orthologues (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). Like for <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6, we started by producing a fragment encompassing the N-terminal domain (denoted crN; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B) and solved its structure to 2.1&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution by X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). We found that the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained three equivalent crN dimers (denoted the crN-dimer hereafter). The monomers in each dimer are related by local 2-fold symmetry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). The overall structure and organization of the crN-dimer, as well as the F145 residue engaged at the N-N interface and corresponding to I154 of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6, are similar to that of the <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> ceN-dimer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>C). The stability of the crN-dimer in solution was assessed by ITC, and the K<sub>d</sub> was determined to be 60 &#x000b1; 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>D), which is similar to that of the ceN-dimer from <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E). Overall, these results indicate that there is strong structural conservation among N-terminal domains of SAS-6 proteins across evolution. In addition, they demonstrate that the function of the critical residue within the &#x003b2;6-&#x003b2;7 loop mediating the interaction between pairs of N-terminal domains is likewise conserved.</p><p>To investigate the structural organization of the Bld12p N-terminal domains in the context of the two-stranded parallel coiled coil, we produced a fragment in which the crN variant was extended by the first six heptad repeats of the Bld12p coiled coil (crN-6HR; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B). AUC experiments conducted at 150&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M protein concentration revealed that crN-6HR forms higher-order oligomeric species (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>E). However, a mutant in which F145 was substituted for glutamate (crN-6HR[F145E]) formed only dimers, as revealed by AUC and MALS experiments (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>E and S4F). The stability of crN-6HR[F145E] was assessed by CD, which yielded a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.5 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>G). We solved the structure of Bld12p crN-6HR[F145E] to 3.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution by X-ray crystallography. The asymmetric unit of the crystal revealed a dimer (denoted the crCC-dimer hereafter; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). Dimerization is brought about by interactions between the two &#x003b1;3 helices, which establish a parallel, two-stranded coiled coil through knobs-into-hole packing of the residues occupying the heptad a and d core positions. The relative orientation of the two N-terminal domains is maintained by predominantly hydrophobic interactions formed between residues of their &#x003b2;3-&#x003b2;4 loops and residues from both coiled-coil &#x003b1;3 helices (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C).</p><p>Having the structures of both the crN-dimer and the crCC-dimer of Bld12p allowed us to build a structural model of higher-order oligomers using both dimer interfaces. Strikingly, when crCC-dimers were associated such that their N-terminal domains interact as observed in the crN-dimer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>), we obtained a ring with a 9-fold symmetry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>; see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">Experimental Procedures</xref> for full description of the modeling). In this structural model, the long axes of the coiled-coil domains are in plane with and radiate out from the ring, which is &#x0223c;3.5&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 5&#x000a0;nm in thickness and &#x0223c;23&#x000a0;nm in mean diameter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B).</p><p>A key prediction of our structural model is that Bld12p possesses properties to self-assemble into a ring with 9-fold symmetry. We tested this hypothesis by performing electron microscopy experiments with bacterially expressed Bld12p. As the full-length protein exhibited unspecific aggregation (data not shown) and as the C-terminal part of Bld12p is not evolutionarily conserved and is predicted to be largely disordered, we produced a Bld12p fragment encompassing the N-terminal and coiled-coil domains (crN-CC; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref>A and S4B). Electron microscopy revealed that crN-CC is an elongated &#x0223c;40&#x000a0;nm rod that displays&#x000a0;a globular head-like moiety at one extremity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). The overall organization of crN-CC is similar to that of the <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> SAS-6 homodimer, with the rod corresponding to the two-stranded parallel coiled coil and the head moiety to the two N-terminal domains (compare <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A with <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Strikingly, at increased concentrations, crN-CC could associate in a head-to-head fashion to form an overall V-shaped structure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). The angle between the two legs of the V was determined to be 42 &#x000b1; 11&#x000b0; (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>E), which suggestively corresponds to approximately one-ninth of&#x000a0;360&#x000b0;.</p><p>Remarkably, we found in addition that crN-CC further assembled into higher-order oligomers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>C) and could form ring-like structures from which emanated spokes corresponding to the coiled-coil domains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>A). The mean diameter of the central ring was 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000a0;nm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F), which is similar to that of the crCC-dimer ring model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B) and of the central hub of the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cartwheel (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalier-Smith, 1974</xref>). In contrast, no higher-order assemblies were obtained with an crN-CC mutant in which glutamate was substituted for F145 (crN-CC[F145E]; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B), demonstrating that this residue is critical for forming V-shaped structures and ring oligomers. Consistent with the findings with crN-CC, the shorter crN-6HR fragment also formed predominantly rings with a diameter similar to that of crN-CC, although radial spokes were not observed in this case given the small size of the crN-6HR coiled coil (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6</xref>C and S6D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Bld12p self-assembles into ring-like structures from which emanate radial spokes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The 9-fold symmetry of centrioles, cilia, and flagella has fascinated biologists since it was discovered decades ago with the advent of electron microscopy. The mechanisms at the origin of this remarkable 9-fold symmetry have inspired many hypotheses (reviewed in <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Strnad and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2008</xref>). For instance, because duplication of the centriole occurs once per cell cycle, as is the case for replication of the genetic material, it has been proposed that centriole formation may similarly rely on nucleic acids (reviewed in <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Marshall and Rosenbaum, 2000</xref>). Our work demonstrates that a protein-based mechanism is sufficient to account for an initial step of centriole formation, as the self-assembly properties of SAS-6 generate a molecular architecture with a 9-fold symmetry that bears striking resemblance with the cartwheel. The cartwheel has been perhaps best described in <italic>C.&#x000a0;reinhardtii</italic> and consists of a central hub from which emanate nine spokes capped by a pinhead-like structure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalier-Smith, 1974</xref>). The cartwheel is the first structure with a 9-fold symmetry apparent at the onset of centriole formation, which has led to the suggestion that it acts as a scaffold onto which centriolar microtubules then assemble (reviewed in <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Strnad and G&#x000f6;nczy, 2008</xref>). Support for this view has come notably from the analysis of <italic>bld12</italic> mutants in which the cartwheel is missing (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nakazawa et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In most cells null for <italic>bld12</italic> function, basal bodies are fragmented into pieces, indicating that the cartwheel is required for centriole formation. Interestingly, in addition, the rare mutant cells that harbor basal&#x000a0;bodies exhibit defects in the 9-fold symmetry, with the number of microtubule blades varying from 7 to 11. This observation strongly supports the notion that the cartwheel is critical for dictating the 9-fold symmetry of centrioles.</p><p>Our findings elucidate the structural basis of the cartwheel and thus of the 9-fold symmetry of centrioles. We first establish that proteins of the SAS-6 family form coiled-coil-mediated homodimers. Our elongated molecular model of SAS-6 and Bld12p homodimers is in contrast to the proposal that <italic>Drosophila</italic> DmSas6 exhibits a globular arrangement (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gopalakrishnan et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Although this may reflect a <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific feature, we note that all proteins of the SAS-6 family contain a predicted coiled-coil domain that is expected to form an extended rod (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho-Santos et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Our work further reveals that interaction between homodimers mediated by adjacent N-terminal domains results in the&#x000a0;oligomerization of SAS-6 homodimers. Strikingly, in addition, recombinant Bld12p homodimeric building blocks self-assemble into an &#x0223c;22&#x000a0;nm ring from which the coiled-coil domains emanate radially. The overall appearance of Bld12p oligomers in our electron micrographs, as well as that of our structural ring model, is remarkably similar to the cartwheel comprising a central hub and radial spokes, as observed in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cavalier-Smith, 1974</xref>).</p><p>Although new centrioles form next to the old ones in most proliferating cells, once per cell cycle, centrioles can also assemble de novo, for instance in multiciliated epithelial cells or after ablation of the resident centrioles (<xref rid="bib17 bib24 bib9" ref-type="bibr">Khodjakov et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Loncarek and Khodjakov, 2009; Dirksen, 1991</xref>). Moreover, the cartwheel also possesses self-assembling properties (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gavin, 1984</xref>). Our findings provide an attractive mechanism for how de novo centriole formation may be achieved, as self-assembly of SAS-6 proteins is sufficient to mediate formation of a structure that bears resemblance to the cartwheel. Although centrioles can assemble de novo in some cases, they form strictly in the vicinity of the old centriole in most proliferating cells. We speculate that this may reflect the fact that the vicinity of the old centriole is a favorable environment for promoting self-assembly of SAS-6 proteins, perhaps because of the local enrichment of other centrosomal components. Alternatively, phosphorylation of SAS-6, for instance as is known to occur in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> through the action of the kinase ZYG-1 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kitagawa et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), could regulate the formation or stability of SAS-6 oligomers. Regardless, it will be of utmost interest to elucidate how the basic ring of SAS-6 homodimers is stabilized so that it can promote the formation of a mature centriole.</p><p>In light of the importance of regulated centrosome duplication in genome stability (reviewed in <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>), the structural information uncovered in this study, and in particular the identification of the residues mediating interaction between adjacent SAS-6 N-terminal domains, represents a promising avenue to modulate centriole formation for therapeutic purposes. Furthermore and in conclusion, because these residues are well conserved among SAS-6 orthologs, we propose that the self-assembly of SAS-6 homodimers into a 9-fold symmetric ring structure is a fundamental property at the root of the universal 9-fold symmetry of centrioles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Protein Preparation and Biophysical Characterization</title><p>Standard cloning and recombinant protein production in bacteria is described in the <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Information</xref>.
